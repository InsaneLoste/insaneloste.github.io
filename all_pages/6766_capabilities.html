<p>User can move in any number of directions and speeds while moving in another direction and speed as well. Basically, this works by distorting and moving the whole space moved in around the user to cause them to do this. The user is moving like how a moon revolves around a moving planet, or a ball and string swung in a circle in a moving bus, but done much easier. Basically, the user does not worry about acceleration and inertia when using this power. The user can thus do things like move in a circle as the space they are in moves forward without the user changing their current motion. This can be done with more than two fields of space moving in different directions and speeds each.
