<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diamagnetism" title="wikipedia:Diamagnetism">diamagnetism</a>: a weak repulsive force formed by the existence of external magnetic fields, energy, or magnetism. In comparison to <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paramagnetism" title="wikipedia:Paramagnetism">paramagnetism</a>, and <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ferromagnetism" title="wikipedia:Ferromagnetism">ferromagnetism</a>: numerous amounts of materials that possess slight attractiveness or powerful pull to magnetism, diamagnetism is the polar opposite, instead of being dragged to a magnetic field, it gets propelled away. The more potent the magnetic field, the stronger the repulsion becomes. Any element or material that is not attractive to magnetism possesses a small degree of diamagnetic properties: water, wood, most organic compounds, some plastics, and many metals. Since the user is not commanding ordinary magnetism, which prominently affects paramagnetic and ferromagnetic material, they can manipulate anything with diamagnetic characteristics or produce them. The user can control the following stated diamagnetic materials, from increasing the diamagnetism of animals to cause them to be easily repelled or levitated from less potent magnetic fields, decreasing diamagnetism to give any material an advantage to be pulled, and possess limited manipulation over anything diamagnetic.
