<p>The user can utilize species-based arts, a specialized system of techniques and practices exclusive to one's own race/species. These arts are completely unavailable to those outside of their own race. Through practice and training, one is capable of exhibiting distinctive techniques based on their racial abilities, including martial skills (attack powers), physical enhancements (heightened senses, speed, strength, etc.), supporting practices (healing) and/or skills affecting the nature of existence (universal force control, reality warping, etc.).
