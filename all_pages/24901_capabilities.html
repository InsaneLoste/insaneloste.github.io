<p>The user is a technorganic abomination, a cybernetic organism/cyborg that has mutative unstable attributes that make them an abomination. These might include <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">rapid growth</a>, <a href="/wiki/Technological_Assimilation" title="Technological Assimilation">assimi</a><a href="/wiki/Digestive_Assimilation" title="Digestive Assimilation">lation</a> and/or <a href="/wiki/Accelerating_Regeneration" title="Accelerating Regeneration">extreme regenerative properties</a> to name a few, but to put it simply as possible, they are an organic abomination in the form of a technorganism.
