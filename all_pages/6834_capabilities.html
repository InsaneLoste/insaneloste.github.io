<p>The user is capable of using divine magic; a godly form of magic that uses godlike forces to mystically use divine powers to achieve impossible feats such as creating, destroying and reconstructing anything in existence, sometimes even to warp reality. This type of magic is usually used by a transcendent/divine being or those related to them such as gods, demigods, angels, etc. Divine Magic also allows those who wield it the capability to go toe-to-toe with that of gods.
