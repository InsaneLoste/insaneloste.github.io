<p>The user is a Seraphim Angel, an extraordinarily powerful upper-level <a href="/wiki/Angel_Physiology" title="Angel Physiology">angel</a> who represents and is associated with the <a href="/wiki/Holy-Fire_Embodiment" title="Holy-Fire Embodiment">holy fires</a> of the heavens, being completely infused with it throughout their entire being. Seraphim possesses two, four, and even six wings on their bodies, one or three faces, and a multitude of eyes on their faces and wings, very similar to <a href="/wiki/Cherubim_Physiology" title="Cherubim Physiology">cherubim angels</a> in many ways. It is said that whoever lays eyes on a seraph would instantly be incinerated due to the immense brightness of their <a href="/wiki/Divinity" title="Divinity">divine power</a> and holy fires. They are depicted as the highest of the angelic hierarchy, standing next to the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Monotheistic_Deity_Physiology" title="Monotheistic Deity Physiology">supreme creator</a>. With near-almighty power, they adore their Lord's actions, authority, presence, and existence, in addition to commanding most of heaven's armies.
