<p>Users can manipulate the concept of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balance_(metaphysics)" title="wikipedia:Balance (metaphysics)">balance</a>, a concept that deals with the equilibrium and stability of opposites, essentially acting like a form of <a href="/wiki/Reality_Warping" title="Reality Warping">reality warping</a>, where users can manifest opposites in any event or infringe on the concept itself. In the former case, any defense can be bypassed (creating equilibrium with the concept of defense by manifesting the opposing force of offense), the dead can be revived (creating equilibrium with the concept of death by manifesting the opposing force of life), people can be blinked into nonexistence (creating equilibrium with the concept of existence by manifesting the opposing force of nonexistence), superpowers can be stolen (creating equilibrium with the concept of superpowers by manifesting the opposing force of powerlessness). In the latter case, one can completely obliterate anything by interfering with their physical, mental, or spiritual stability, creating a fatal in-balance that causes them to cease to exist.
