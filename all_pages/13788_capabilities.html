<p>Users of this power can either mimic the traits of a Lauma or are one, a Lauma is a type of nature spirit and fairy from Baltic folklore that was believed to have originated as a divine being but loved the human world so much they gave up part of their divinity so as to walk among the mortal world, though they still had a large number of supernatural powers at their disposal. Mostly benevolent they had an especial fondness for children and could take the form of mares, bears, goats, dogs or anthropomorphic versions of these creatures - as well as beautiful humanoid females, they could sometimes be dangerous to males but in general were among the more openly caring of the "good folk". Attracted to natural areas they would dance, forming fairy circles in the process, they would also sing and were masters of weaving and spinning - they were said to be most active on rainy days and when not visiting the mortal realms existed in the clouds atop diamond thrones.
