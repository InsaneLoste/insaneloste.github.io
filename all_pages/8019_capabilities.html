<p>User can create, shape, and manipulate the electromagnetic disturbance known as noise, an extremely dangerous electromagnetic wave, that can disturb electromagnetic wave-based technology and kill electromagnetic wave-based life forms. The key of this power is the ability to harmonize with the noise. User can control or generate noise, this includes mimicking its properties. This power grants the capacity to survive in noise-made areas without being affected. Additionally, noise can affect computer data by distorting, corrupting or destroying it.
