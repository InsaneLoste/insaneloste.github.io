<p>The user is able to create living beings through the manipulation of weather. Whether they form the basis of their physiology or are the animating/creative force, meteorological essences are used to create newfound animated existences. They can come with sentience and even souls when created. This power allows for actual life to come into being, not simply weather-based forms. The life creation aspect also makes it so the entities do not need to be made of weather; they can simply be powered by them.
