<p>Users can either create bombs capable of altering the genetic properties of many individuals or are one. In order to qualify, the bomb must cause a significant and often lasting change upon detonation which results in an alteration of the genetic qualities of a society, world or setting. Often, it can cause mutation in human or animal life, both good and bad. It may reverse evolution, accelerate evolution or completely change natural evolution. In some cases, it may even genetically assimilate one species into another.
