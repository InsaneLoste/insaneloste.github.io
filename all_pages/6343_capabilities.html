<p>The user can assign or re-assign the destinies of others or themselves. For example, if the user or another is fated to die or experience misfortune at a certain moment, the user can re-assign that destiny to be placed on another. Users can also change whether or not they are destined to receive a form of fortune by assigning the fortunate destiny of another to themselves.
