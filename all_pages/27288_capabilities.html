<p>The user can utilize the Weather Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around meteorological power. Weather plays a significant role as a part of nature, affecting the prevalence of life forms, the movement of elemental materials and the creation of geological formations. Learning to control it allows one to exhibit techniques such as energy-related combat skill (lightning-charged attacks/defense), movement enhancement (using air/wind for flight) and extra-sensory connection (possessing a link to the environment). The training allows one access to various forces like pressure, temperature and raw energy; further practice can even allow one to control these fundamental aspects for whatever skill may be necessary.
