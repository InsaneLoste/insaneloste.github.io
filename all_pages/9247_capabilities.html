<p>The user can expand their agility/dexterity capabilities to multiple objects, including the one the user is currently on or in. From boxes to vehicles, the user can control all those objects at once even if they are not on or inside all of them but just one. It is like piloting multiple ships at a time. The user is capable of doing athletic feats while they are on or in these objects, and make the other objects they are not on/in do amazing things.
