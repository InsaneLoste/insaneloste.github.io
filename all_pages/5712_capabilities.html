<p>The user can memorize the damage they take and render themselves immune to it. Whether the damage is from an opponent or self-inflicted, the user cannot be harmed in the same manner that was used to inflict damage upon them. For example, if the user assimilates the pain and damage after being cut with a sword/blade, they will become immune to the damage potential of metal-based, bladed weapons.
