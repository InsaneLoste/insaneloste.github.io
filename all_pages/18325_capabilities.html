<p>The user's intellectual faculties (memory, calculation, learning, creativity, etc.) transcend virtually all other sentient beings in their universe. They can always make the wisest decision regardless of any situation and can also avoid absolutely any mistakes. This power is inferior to <a href="/wiki/Omniscience" title="Omniscience">Omniscience</a> as the user has essentially limitless wisdom, rather than having innate knowledge/experience of everything. The user has the greatest, most supreme understanding and realization of concepts, common sense, people, things, events or situations, resulting in the ability to apply perceptions, judgements, and actions while keeping these understandings. It often requires control of one's emotional reactions (the "passions") so that universal principles, reasons, and knowledge prevail to determine one's actions.
