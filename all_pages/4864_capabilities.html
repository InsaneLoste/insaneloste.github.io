<p>User can manipulate the abstracts (or concept) of earth/earthen matter. This can have many feats, such as earth possessing unique physical qualities (such as being liquid without being molten, gem-like without being crystallized, ductile and conductive without being metallic), earth that never depletes of nutrients and minerals no matter how many crops are planted or how long/often it is tilled, and even earth that is not bound by fundamental forces like gravity, being capable of freely moving through the air.
