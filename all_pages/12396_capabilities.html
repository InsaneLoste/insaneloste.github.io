<p>The user of this ability can influence and control all forms of fish and use them to do their bidding (help in a fight, save someone, kill someone, etc). The user could also call them from any ocean in the world (for example, calling a great white shark in the Atlantic Ocean while being in the Indian ocean). The user can also understand or communicate with them, hence creating and strengthening friendships.
