<p>Users can hear in a way that isn't connected to their physical senses, on distances beyond their normal ranges, or being able to sense sounds that are beyond their normal auditory range. They may be able to hear psychic/spiritual levels/beings. In addition, the user could psychically perceive voices and other sounds from past events, future events or locations currently beyond hearing range. Furthermore, perceive voices from disembodied spirits and other extradimensional entities. Users could even psychically receive auditory sensations (earache, sudden heightened hearing volume or range, sudden deafness, ringing in the ears, etc), with the presence of psychic energy.
