<p>Users of this power are oneness deities, making the user both The Creator and Creation. The user is an all-encompassing being of which everything is part of or exists within them. The universe/nature, and they are identical or in a nutshell, are at times totally immanent in creation.  All forms of reality may then be considered either modes of the user, or identical with it. The universe (in the sense of the totality of all existence) and God (Being the user) are identical.
