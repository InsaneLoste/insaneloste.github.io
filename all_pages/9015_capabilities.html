<p>Users can manipulate space with supernatural properties that the normal variant would not be able to do. This involves controlling forces where one can affect things that regular spatial manipulation could not, as well as go to places where one normally could not (from the living world to the world of the dead or vice versa, spirit world, etc.), and harm entities that would normally be immune (i.e. demons, angels, gods and spirits).
