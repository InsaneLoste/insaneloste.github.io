<p>The user can create, shape, and manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Velocity" title="wikipedia:Velocity">velocity</a> of any moving object: the speed and direction an object is moving. They could simply move things around: by controlling their velocity, user could fly; cancel object velocity to make it freeze where it is, and even use velocity as a sort of force blast, blasting things away at high speeds.
