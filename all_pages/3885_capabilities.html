<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a cecaelia, a variation on <a href="/wiki/Merfolk_Physiology" title="Merfolk Physiology">merfolk</a> with a cephalopode (usually octopus) lower body. Unlike many other merfolk, they are rarely able to transform their bodies into fully humanoid ones and are thus highly limited when on land.
