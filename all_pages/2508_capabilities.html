<p>The user has a unique existence/personal timeline in the whole multiverse, meaning that their past, future, present, existence, destiny or being cannot be borrowed, mimicked, stolen, switched, etc. The user has alternate selves in alternate realities and points in time, but their own history, being and future is singular, and their alternate selves in different realities may need to have completely different histories and futures from the user with this power.
