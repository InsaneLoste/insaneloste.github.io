It is made of the sum of the kinetic energy of its particles and the potential energy of its particles’ interactions meaning the overall magnitude is dependent on the amount of substance available. Internal energy changes are done by matter and/or heat exchanges or by doing <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(thermodynamics)" title="wikipedia:Work (thermodynamics)">work</a>.
