<p>The user can utilize the Thermal Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around thermokinetic power. Thermal energy is a special form of kinetic energy based around the movement of atomic or molecular particles, which, itself, defines the amount of thermal energy that is detected. Greater kinetic energy creates higher temperatures (heat) while less energy creates lower temperatures (cold). This range of energetic activity can create various physical effects on the environment and sensations in living beings. By learning to master thermal energy, a user can gain specialized power and skills ranging from combat capability to physical enhancement to creative techniques like transportation. While a user may only be able to wield one temperature range initially, training could help one learn how to control the full scope of temperatures and their related aspects.
