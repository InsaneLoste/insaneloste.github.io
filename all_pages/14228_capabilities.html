<p>Users can create, shape, and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lightning" title="wikipedia:Lightning">lightning</a>, a form of <a href="/wiki/Electricity_Manipulation" title="Electricity Manipulation">electricity</a> within the upper <a href="/wiki/Atmosphere_Creation" title="Atmosphere Creation">atmosphere</a> resulting from the movement of <a href="/wiki/Charged_Particles_Manipulation" title="Charged Particles Manipulation">charged particles</a>. As lightning bolts are giant sparks of high-voltage electrical discharges caused by imbalance charges in the atmosphere between storm clouds, the air, the ground, or within the clouds themselves, and in the early stages of development, the air acts as an insulator between the positive and negative charges in the cloud and between the cloud and the ground. Generally, through <a href="/wiki/Weather_Manipulation" title="Weather Manipulation">atmokinetic</a> or electrokinetic abilities, these users can excite and control these particles to cause lightning with their will, directing it to wherever they wish if focused, even simulating electrokinesis through them by channeling; however, this can be difficult and incredibly powerful to control.
