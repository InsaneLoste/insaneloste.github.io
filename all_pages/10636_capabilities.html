<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into an <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gargoyle" title="wikipedia:Gargoyle">gargoyle</a>, a winged humanoid with a penchant for perching on high terrain. Given their origins as statues of grotesque humans and animals designed to ward off evil spirits and channel rainwater from rooftops, they also tend to have an ability to turn to stone, voluntarily or not. Few are actually living stone.
