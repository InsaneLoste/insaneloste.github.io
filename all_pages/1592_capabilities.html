<p>The user can utilize the Apocalyptic Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around cataclysmic power. There are many faiths, myths and traditions related to the end of the world. This event is often connected to astoundingly powerful forces and disastrous events affecting most of, if not, the entirety of a world or even a whole universe. It may be the result of supernatural entities like deities or potent natural forces like cosmic energies. Though these powers are inherently devastating, through unique training, one can learn to harness them to perform any number of techniques. Potentially, they can range from unleashing natural disasters (storms, earthquakes, droughts) to manifesting apocalyptic essences (famine, pestilence, conquest, strife, war, death) to bringing about the end to some type of system (destroying worlds or removing cycles like reincarnation).
