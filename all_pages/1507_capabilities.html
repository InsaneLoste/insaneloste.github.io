<p>The user can create malformed versions of worlds on a multiversal scale. Creating a second multiverse filled with an infinite collection of blasphemous and chaotic realities. A verse formed of every fear and bad decision ever made or dreamt, a verse made up of every possible horror imaginable and grows more powerful with every evil action, bad thought or sin from the original multiverse and it's inhabitants. This verse literally feeds and thrives off "everything wrong".
