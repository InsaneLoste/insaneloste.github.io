<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_energy" title="wikipedia:Gravitational energy">gravitational energy</a>, i.e., the energy a body with mass has in relation to another massive object. The energy is connected to gravity or gravitational force and kinetic energy. An object has its own gravitational field that draws it to a larger object, like the Earth. As an object is positioned high above the ground, its gravitational energy increases while its kinetic energy decreases. As the object plummets towards the ground, its kinetic energy increases while its gravitational energy decreases.
