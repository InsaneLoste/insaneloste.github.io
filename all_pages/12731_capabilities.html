<p>The user has counteractive forces generated to counteract their heavy mass and inertia. So when they are heavy with a high mass, planetary mass or even infinite mass, the user has super-strong forces that counteract that heaviness and make the user light. This makes it so they can move as well as a light person, despite their mass and inertia. With that, they can move without their heavy mass breaking or moving things, such as the ground or floor or even a planet itself.
