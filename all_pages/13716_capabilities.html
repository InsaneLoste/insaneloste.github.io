<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lamia" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">lamia</a>, originally a beautiful queen of Libya who became a child-eating daemon. In the myth, Lamia is a mistress of the god Zeus, causing Zeus' jealous wife, Hera, to kill all of Lamia's children and transform her into a monster that hunts and devours the children of others. Another version has Hera stealing all of Lamia's children and Lamia, who loses her mind from grief and despair, starts stealing and devouring others' children out of envy, the repeated monstrosity of which transforms her into a monster.
