<p>The user with this ability is able to hear despite lacking ears. Having no ears is normally perceived as a defect, but this is not always the case, as this form of earlessness is definitely a power in terms of origin due to not only giving the subject the immunity to deafness-inducing sources and having their hearing obliterated, but despite possibly having their old hearing lost upon retrieval, a new kind of hearing ability will then begin to manifest that allows them to hear, but not in the same way other subjects do.
