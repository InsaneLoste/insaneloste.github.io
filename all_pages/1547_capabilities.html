<p>The user can utilize the Antiparticle Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around the power of antiparticles (anti-gravitons, antineutrinos, antiprotons, photons, positrons). These elementary units are virtually identical to their respective particle counterparts; however, they feature an opposing set of characteristics (opposite charge, opposite forces). As they are basic units behind the makeup of certain facets of reality, training to control them allows users a variety of effects. Aside from being able to create antimatter, one can use them to enhance their physical aspects, destroy normally-charged matter or even channel anti-forces related to them (anti-gravity, anti-magic). Whatever can be accomplished with particles can be equally yet oppositely done through the Antiparticle Arts.
