<p>The user either is or can transform into a biodroid with near god-like powers, a bioengineered life-form designed to be a perfect form of organic being resembling actual life. A biodroid has transformed their entire form of being into a transcendent version of themselves; this godlike inner form can be their most powerful state. Gaining limitless, godlike abilities, skills, and traits that manifest the users' most absolute selves in being. Created through artificial biotechnology or a blend of biological and technological. While staying in the organic form, capable of being anything their makers wish for them to be, having a perfectly organic and programmable status that grants them all necessary and perfectly designed organic material to make them perfectly functional life forms. While being created through organic means and possessing powers on the level of deities that aren't bound to the natural laws or limits of regular gods due to their artificial nature.
