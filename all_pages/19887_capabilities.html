<p>Users are <a href="/wiki/Omniscience" title="Omniscience">all-knowing</a> over the future, possessing limitless, infinite, absolute and maximum knowledge and information over all impending events. This allows them to know down to the exact picosecond when something takes place as well as infinite branches and possibilities in the future, allowing them to "change the future" before it even happens by looking at which decisions one must make to achieve a desired outcome. Their knowledge of the future is so infinite and absolute that they can not only foresee their own future, they can even foresee the future of everything in Existence (i.e., other living beings, objects, places, civilizations and even the whole universe, including those/things that have yet to come into existence.)
