<p>The user can create, shape, and manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Surface_energy" title="wikipedia:Surface energy">surface energy</a>, the energy associated with surface properties: the energy required for the creation of a new surface and the excess amount of energy on a material (substrate) surface compared to the bulk of the material. Molecular cohesion keeps atoms in balance, and it would normally take a certain amount of energy to break the material apart, creating new surfaces. As temperature increases, the surface energy requirement decreases since the atoms become excited and destabilized. It is also the adhesive force of a substrate, as higher surface energy means higher molecular attraction (water on an unwaxed car spreading or “wetting” out). Lower surface energy means lower molecular attraction (water on a waxed car forming droplets).
