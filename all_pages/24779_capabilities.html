<p>This is a team power where multiple users can combine their strengths to form powerful attacks against common adversaries. For example, if someone with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Electric_Manipulation" title="Electric Manipulation">Electric Manipulation</a> combines an attack with someone that used an attack with <a href="/wiki/Water_Manipulation" title="Water Manipulation">Water Manipulation</a>. Not only do they do more damage than their attacks alone, but most likely be done at a bigger radius to take out more foes.
