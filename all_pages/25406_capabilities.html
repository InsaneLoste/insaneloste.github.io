<p>The user can compress the flow of temporal energy, stacking the currents into multiple layers, creating a pocket dimension of extremely high density of time. Inside this subspace dimension of increased density of time flows differently than that of the outside dimension, either by a much faster rate dependent on the proportional density, or so dense that it stops entirely.
