<p>The user is able to reduce the length of telomeres, either their own or others. Telomeres are a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromatid, protecting the DNA fragments; they grow shorter as cell division occurs, an indication of the person getting older. By shortening the telomeres, one can reduce the lifespan of themselves or others.
