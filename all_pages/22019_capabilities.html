<p>Users of this power can selectively choose what parts of a person or objects get harmed and which parts do not get harmed when they attack. For example, if they were to stab through where the heart of a person is, but do not want to damage the heart itself, they can make their attacks pass through the heart harmlessly while the other parts that are struck get damage. They can also make it, so the heart and brain remain intact and safe when the opponent gets crushed.
