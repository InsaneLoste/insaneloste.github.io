<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a duality deity, a god/goddess who represents or is associated with duality, balance, equilibrium, and opposites. Deities of this type are usually two deity types in one. For example, if a duality deity personifies goodness and benevolence, then said deity would also personify evil and malevolence. Other examples could exist, such as a creator deity who also is a destroyer deity. A deity only needs to personify two opposite concepts to be considered a duality deity. Duality deities were not common in mythology but were important among ancient and current civilizations.
