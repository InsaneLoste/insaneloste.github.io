<p>The user can manipulate particles into high energy states and then launch (accelerate) them at the velocities high enough for them to exert a destructive force over great distances. The particles that the user can manipulate depend on their skills, but can be either that of atoms, protons, molecules, neutrons, electrons, ions, gravitons, photons, tachyons, etc.
