<p>The user can generate powerful wind currents by strongly flapping their wings like large fans in the desired direction. This form of wind manipulation is usually limited to powerful, directional gales, although generating other standard wind techniques (tornadoes, <a href="/wiki/Razor_Wind" title="Razor Wind">Razor Wind</a>, etc.) with this method isn't unheard of. Users with propellers can perform similar maneuvers by pointing their rotors at their targets and spinning them very quickly, while users with other appendages (arms, tails, etc.) can accomplish similar effects by rapidly and/or strongly flapping/swinging said appendages.
