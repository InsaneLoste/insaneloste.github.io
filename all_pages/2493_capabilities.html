<p>The user is able to control <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Beetle" title="wikipedia:Beetle">beetles</a>, a type of insect. They control them to do their bidding, for example, helping them during situations, using them against foes, and using them to see locations and gather information about a particular place. Some can see through the beetles' eyes that are controlled, allowing them to spy on others. Users can also understand or communicate with them, hence creating and strengthening friendships.
