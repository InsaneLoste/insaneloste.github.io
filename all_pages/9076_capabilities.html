<p>Users with this ability are capable of induce others into a state of eternal slumber without making the target fully immortal yet also keeping them safe from several hazards that would kill a target under a similar sleep-induced state; thus a victim is immune to aging, muscle weakening and hunger/thirst but can still die from other means, they are also not granted any healing or regenerative abilities while in such a sleep.
