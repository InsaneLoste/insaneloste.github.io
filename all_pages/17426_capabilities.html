<p>User can release energy in every direction at once. This ability allows the user to attack many foes at once and possibly destroy large areas like villages. The amount of force and damage depends on factors such as the individual strength of the user or their power, and the specific techniques used. The same is true of the range, which depends not only on the previous factors but may also be impacted by environmental factors. For example, some kinds of energy may be able to pass through walls while others may not. Similarly, if the attack is a giant blast of thermal energy, a cold environment may shorten the range in a way that it would not have the attack been of kinetic energy.
