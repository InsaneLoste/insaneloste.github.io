<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redcap" title="wikipedia:Redcap">redcap</a>, a malevolent, murderous goblin found in Border folklore. They are depicted as "a short, thickset old man with long prominent teeth, skinny fingers armed with talons like eagles, large eyes of a fiery red color, grisly hair streaming down his shoulders, iron boots, a pikestaff in his left hand, and a red cap on his head". When travelers take refuge in his lair, he flings huge stones at them; and if he kills them, he soaks his cap in their blood, giving it a crimson hue. He is unaffected by human strength, but can be driven away by words of Scripture or by the brandishing of a crucifix, which cause him to utter a dismal yell and vanish in flames, leaving behind a large tooth. While traditionally male, more modern version include redcaps of both genders.
