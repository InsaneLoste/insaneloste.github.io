<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thermochemistry" title="wikipedia:Thermochemistry">thermochemistry</a>, the scientific field that deals with the relationships between chemical reactions, energy, and heat. When chemical reactions occur, there can be a temperature-based effect along with the creation of new substances. An <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exothermic_process" title="wikipedia:Exothermic process">exothermic reaction</a> releases heat into the environment, creating a hot sensation. An <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endothermic_process" title="wikipedia:Endothermic process">endorthemic reaction</a> absorbs heat, resulting in a cold sensation. These kinds of reactions play a big role in natural processes like calorie conversion and artificial processes like engine combustion.
