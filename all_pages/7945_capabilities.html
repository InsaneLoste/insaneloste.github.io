<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a elemental; a creature with a natural affinity towards elements (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, etc.) and elemental-based elements. Some elementals may be born from the elements or related elements. They can wield limited but potent elemental-based powers and abilities of their very own.
