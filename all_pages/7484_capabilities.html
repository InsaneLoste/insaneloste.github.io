<p>Users are or can either embody or transform into an <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Id,_ego_and_super-ego#Ego" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ego</a>; the Freudian representation of the individual's existence in the world. In other words, the part of the mind that acknowledges individuality. In Sigmund Freud's theory, the Id (one's deepest, unfiltered desires) and the Superego (the part of the mind that places foreign factors like other people into consideration) insert suggestions to the Ego (one's own sense of identity). While the Id and the Superego are meant to tempt the Ego, the Ego is the one who ultimately decides which route to take.
