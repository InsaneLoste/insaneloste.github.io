<p>The user can manipulate the rareness and value of anything, decreasing the amount of something to make it fewer in number and thus make things rare, erasing a number of the kinds of object in the process or increasing the amount of something to make it higher in number, makingÂ things common. They can decide where these items can be found or who owns them as well. The value of an object, and its desirability can be altered as well.
