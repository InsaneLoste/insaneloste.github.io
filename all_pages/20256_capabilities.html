<p>The user can cause individuals to emit a psionic signal compelling others to run away or flock toward the desired subject. Whoever is around the desired subject has no control over their actions and will subconsciously desire to move toward or away from the psionally signalled being. The user can choose the number of people who would be affected by the signal. The user's power can also work in other ways like instilling the signal for a person to run away from the user if the user desires that person to do so. In this manner, the user usesÂ their signal placement on a person and the person will just start to running away with no control whatsoever and not even knowing why.
