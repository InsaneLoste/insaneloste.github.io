<p>Users exist independently of <a class="external text" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">logic</a> and are capable of transcend it completely, allowing them to do things without any justification or reason behind them. This lets them easily do logically impossible things, including defeating <a href="/wiki/Ultimate_Power" title="Ultimate Power">infinitely powerful beings</a> with relative ease.
