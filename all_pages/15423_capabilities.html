<p>User can inhabit or take over the body of other beings, whether sentient or not, by stealing their motor functions and senses. Users have to leave their own body for this to take place. Disembodied users such as spirits may use the body as their own. A powerful enough user may not even be limited to inhabiting other entities, but inanimate objects, structures or environments as well.
