<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Balaur" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Balaur</a>, a dragon-like creature with multiple heads, stony or steely serpentine scales, wings, fins, and legs. Most stories describe them with multiple heads, ranging in number from three to twelve, but some tales depict them with a single head or one head in front and one at the end of their tails. Often the balaur was depicted as a creature of epic proportions, one that "plant its footsteps on the mountain and touch the violet skies with its lofty crest."
