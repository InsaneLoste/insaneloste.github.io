<p>The user is able to practically move, even when they don't move. Though while they are not moving, their body acts like it is in motion. So they feel the wind move by them as if they are actually moving, though they are not. If the motion is going forward when the user is facing forward, they will still be hit by projectiles, but if the projectile is coming from other directions, they will miss because the user is "moving", and from behind, the projectile may not be able to reach the target before landing because the user is "moving". The user has their speed multiplied when they actually do move thanks to this power, and they might be able to create afterimages as well. The user also has control over what direction the body "moves"  when still or moving, and sometimes at speed.
