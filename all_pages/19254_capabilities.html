<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Plasticine" title="wikipedia:Plasticine">plasticine</a> , a form of modelling <a href="/wiki/Clay_Manipulation" title="Clay Manipulation">clay</a> that is made from calcium salts, petroleum jelly, and aliphatic acids. It is used extensively for children's play, but also as a modelling medium for more formal or permanent structures, and because of its non-drying property, it is a popular choice of material for stop-motion animation.
