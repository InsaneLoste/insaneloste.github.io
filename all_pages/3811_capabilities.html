<p>The user is made up of or can transform their body completely into <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardboard" title="wikipedia:Cardboard">cardboard</a>, a type of paper-based product with higher thickness and durability. A user's transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of cardboard, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
