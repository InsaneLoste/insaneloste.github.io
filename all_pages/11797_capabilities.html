<p>The user has luck that is applicable to heroic situations, meaning that heroic figures are always fortunate in heroic circumstances, causing good luck to themselves and their companions because of a shared heroic quest while also bringing bad luck to their enemies at the right and specific circumstances. For example, a crime boss pulls out a gun and pulls the trigger and the gun is jammed or when a hero with no combat experience defeats a group of people single handily.
