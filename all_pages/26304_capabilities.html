<p>The user can exert forces of different magnitude on different parts of their body, like exerting more force to move the right leg rather than the left leg, causing it to move faster than it normally would. This could be useful if parts of the user's body are heavier than others. This can be done by focusing one's strength into different parts of the body or by other means.
