<p>User can create, shape and manipulate the skies of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Sky Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiment of the sky itself. As such, they can cause natural sky-related phenomena to manifest, such as creating auroras, calling upon lightning, make it rain, etc. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Sky Manipulation as the sky represents the domain of the user.
