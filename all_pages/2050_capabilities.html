<p>User can freeze the air/atmosphere itself regardless of air quality, abundant and trace gases, air temperature, etc., allowing them to either convert that air/atmosphere directly to ice or simply super chill it. Freezing the air can cause <a href="/wiki/Deoxygenation" title="Deoxygenation">Deoxygenation</a> by way of freezing the oxygen needed to breathe, it can also bypass defensive powers like <a href="/wiki/Cold_Immunity" title="Cold Immunity">Cold Immunity</a> since the atmosphere is whats being frozen it can render the target immobile regardless of immunity.
