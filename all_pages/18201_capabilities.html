<p>The user's physical lifting capacity is greater than <a href="/wiki/Bodybuilding_Mastery" title="Bodybuilding Mastery">Olympic class weightlifters</a>. They are capable of over-head lifting several times their own body weight (numerous times at the minimum), up to an 1,100-2,200 lbs level (about 500 to 1000 kg), and bench-press up to 2,200-4,000 lbs level (about 1000 to 1814 kg), allowing them to lift objects on their own that would require multiple people.
