<p>The user can <a href="/wiki/Category:Inducement_Powers" title="Category:Inducement Powers">make</a> effects <a href="/wiki/Inducement" title="Inducement">happen</a> without a cause or agent, bypassing causality/causation/cause and effect. Other than perhaps the use of their power, the cause is nonexistent when this is done. For the most part, the effect of something needs a cause to happen, but that is not the case with this power.
