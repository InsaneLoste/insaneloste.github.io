<p>The user is a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Furaribi" title="wikipedia:Furaribi">furaribi</a>, a bird-like yokai wrapped in fire. This yokai floats aimlessly through the night. It has the body of a bird, and it's face is a mix between a dog and the god, Garuda. They are a type of hi-no-tama. It is said, if a person does not receive the proper ceremonial service, the remains of your soul will collect with other souls and it will not move on into the afterlife and become a furaribi.
