<p>Users of this ability can take on the traits of a chort or are one, a demonic creature from Slavic mythology that has many similarities to imps and devils in folktales from around the world. Chorts seek to trick humans into selling their souls in exchange for wishes, but may also pursue evil souls so as to drag them to Hell. While powerful and crafty beings, chorts can also become the tools of even smarter heroes to accomplish tasks via tricking the demons, some tasks chorts have been tricked into doing include building an entire castle in a single day and even moving or creating hills and mountains.
