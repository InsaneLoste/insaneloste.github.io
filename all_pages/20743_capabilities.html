They are amongst the largest single objects in the known universe. Quasars are luminous and were first identified as being high redshift sources of electromagnetic energy, including radio waves and visible light, and appeared to be similar to stars, rather than extended sources similar to galaxies. Their luminosity can be 100 times greater than that of the Milky Way.
