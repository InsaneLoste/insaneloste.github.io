<p>The user's mind is either spread through all of what constitutes their atomic make-up or capable of performing operations or prehensile motions at the atomic scale of their being, which is the smallest unit of ordinary matter that forms a chemical element. Being capable of using their atoms (and everything made up of them in their body), the user can handle their atomic composition as if they're limbs or "building blocks" to refashion their being to their advantage.
