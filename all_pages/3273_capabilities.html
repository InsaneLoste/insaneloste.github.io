<p>The user can restore and return bodies to those who have lost them by various means. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Body_Creation" title="Body Creation">creation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Regrowth" title="Regrowth">regrowth</a>, the target's body is not created from scratch or regrown, rather its restored to the point as if they never lost it in the first place.
