<p>User is made up of or can transform their body completely into <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Carnivorous_plant" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">carnivorous plant</a>, from factual species like the Venus flytrap to fictional ones. Users transformed form can be anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of plant, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
