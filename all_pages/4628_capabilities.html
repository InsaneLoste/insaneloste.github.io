The solution tends to possess the same state of matter the solvent has if it has a higher concentration. <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Suspension_(chemistry)" title="wikipedia:Suspension (chemistry)">Suspensions</a> are heterogeneous (unevenly distributed) mixtures where solute particles do not dissolve and tend to remain suspended throughout the solvent. Given enough time, the particles could settle. Colloids occupy a unique place amongst these substances in that they are homogeneous, yet the smaller particles do not dissolve away. As they are not chemically combined, they can be physically separated.
