<p>Users can utilize the Corruption Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around corrupted power. There are various instances of individuals who can wield powerful forces that can grant them supernatural abilities, but are also defined by their defiled natures. These essences can cause lingering, detrimental harm to the victims and the environment, alter the forms and natures of various entities (usually in an unnatural and twisted way) or even cause these kinds of effects on the user, polluting their being. They often become darker, distorted or even monstrous versions of themselves by wielding such power. Learning to wield corrupted essences can grant one great power such as enhanced physiology, access to defiled energies/matter or even the power to alter the nature of reality in a tainted way; however, one must be careful not to be overtaken by this power, as its inherent quality is one of contamination.
