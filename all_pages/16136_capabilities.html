<p>The user can create, shape, and manipulate <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mud_volcano" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">mud volcanoes</a>, formations created by geo-exuded slurries (usually including water) and gases with temperatures ranging from near 100 째C (212 째F) to occasionally 2 째C (36 째F), they are not true (igneous) volcanoes as they produce no lava. About 86% of the gas released from these structures is methane, with much less carbon dioxide and nitrogen emitted. Ejected materials are often a slurry of fine solids suspended in liquids which may include water, which is frequently acidic or salty, and hydrocarbon fluids.
