<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/chupacabra" title="wikipedia:chupacabra">chupacabra</a>, most commonly described as a reptile-like creature, appearing to have leathery or scaly greenish-gray skin and sharp spines or quills running down its back. It is approximately 3-4 feet (1-1.2 m) high, and stands and hops in a similar fashion to a kangaroo. This variety is said to have a dog or panther-like nose and face, a forked tongue, and large fangs. It is said to hiss and screech when alarmed, as well as leave behind a sulfuric stench. When it screeches, some reports assert that the chupacabra's eyes glow an unusual red which gives the witnesses nausea.
