<p>The user can manipulate how things are in other places, planets, environments, etc. They can merge places together into one, affect whether the target can survive in that place or not, conditions and (if any) different physical laws. They can make the target gain new skills, powers, knowledge etc. as they enter a new environment, for example, entering new country/another planet, their existence changes physically and mentally, as if they have always been a part of the country while becoming an urban legend where they were originally from.
