<p>User, either innately or through training, are masters of using a pair of scissors as a melee weapon with supernatural accuracy and proficiency, as effective as swordsmen utilizing swords or gunmen using firearms. They can wield scissors as though they are extensions of their body parts, easily slicing through steel and other defensive materials, dependent on the weapon's sharpness and the user's strength, without causing recoil damage to the weapon. Defensively, the user can block and deflect attacks, even cut up projectiles in mid-flight.
