<p>User can create, shape and manipulate eldritch locations, or otherworldly locations that may or may not be found in another dimension. Eldritch Locations are incomprehensibly strange places where reality is out to lunch and full of sights no mere mortal was ever  meant to experience. Eldritch  Locations take on many forms such as Primordial Chaos, Bizarre  Buildings that break the laws of nature, Incomprehensible  Voids, Strange Planets, Wonderlands  and even Alternate Universes. They are places where nothing makes any sense and everything is completely illogical and defies belief/explanation/reason. They are places that are impossible by their very nature.The user can manipulate these locations and everything in them, including all the aspects of eldritch areas, from the purely physical ones and also mythical/conceptual ones.
