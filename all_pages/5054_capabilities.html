<p>The user can transfer imprisoned targets abilities/resources (including powers, possessions, position, etc.) other targets (whether living or unliving), including themselves. For example, if the individual caught is an <a href="/wiki/Civilization_Manipulation" title="Civilization Manipulation">influential member of a community</a> or has unique qualities onto themselves, their <a href="/wiki/Economy_Manipulation" title="Economy Manipulation">resources and connections</a> can be moved, for example to the user.
