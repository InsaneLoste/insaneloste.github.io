<p>Users have the ability to only be perceived by certain means or people. The user could control what parts of them are imperceptible, whether it be a small or large detail. They could be completely imperceptible or perceived as a "water-downed" version of their true form (ex. a <a href="/wiki/Unicorn_Physiology" title="Unicorn Physiology">unicorn</a> being perceived by an adult/someone who doesn't believe in them, as having less features, like a regular white horse with no horn.).
