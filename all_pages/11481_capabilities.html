<p>The user is/can become an Hantu Air. A Hantu Air is a type of spirit from Malaysian folklore that is believed to be the spirit of any body of water, ranging from large rivers and lakes to small puddles - these spirits were invisible to humans but could interact in numerous ways, while they could be neutral or benevolent they were often malevolent and thus conflict between them and humans was common.
