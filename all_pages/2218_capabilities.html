<p>Users are <a href="/wiki/Omnipotence" title="Omnipotence">all-powerful</a> over themselves, including their existence. They can make their existence ineffable and independent of all <a href="/wiki/Freedom" title="Freedom">laws</a>, also rewriting themselves on absolutely all levels, including <a href="/wiki/Structure_Manipulation" title="Structure Manipulation">structure</a>, <a href="/wiki/Self_Origin_Manipulation" title="Self Origin Manipulation">origin</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Personal_Plot" title="Personal Plot">conclusion</a>, and many more. With absolute control over themselves, they can essentially do anything as long as it stems from their own existence, like granting oneself <a href="/wiki/Complete_Arsenal" title="Complete Arsenal">all powers/abilities</a>, becoming <a href="/wiki/Unity" title="Unity">one with everything</a>, attaining <a href="/wiki/Perfection" title="Perfection">true perfection</a>, etc.
