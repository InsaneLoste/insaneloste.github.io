<p>The user can induce <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_sin" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">eternal sins</a> onto others, which is a sin thatâ€™s stated to arise when a soul willingly rejects the existence and authority of the <a class="text" href="https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Archetype:Monotheistic_Deity?so=search" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Supreme Being</a>, the act must be done with full knowledge that the deity exists and full acceptance of their role as an omnipotent power: for example a character must see a Meta Miracle or Divine Manifestation, a chance for Salvation and directly reject said Salvation.
