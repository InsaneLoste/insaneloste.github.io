<p>Users of this power are eternal in two aspects: possessing <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Absolute_Immortality" title="Absolute Immortality">no end</a> as well as <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Non_Created_Physiology" title="Non Created Physiology">no beginning</a>. They were never created by anything and will never be concluded, existing in all points of time. No matter how deep one goes into past or future, they will never find a point where the user starts or ends, as these beings are truly eternal.
