<p>The user can utilize the Sacrificial Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around oblational power. Sacrifices have long been associated with tributes to higher powers and exchanges of favor. By making a specific offering, one would gain supernatural aid in some form. This practice can be especially difficult since the offerings can be extremely varied and costly (property, bodily substances like blood, living beings). While there is always a price to pay, training in sacrificial practices can allow one to gain extremely powerful abilities, ranging from physical enhancements to miraculous events to divine blessings. One simply has to consider if the reward outweighs the cost incurred by the techniques.
