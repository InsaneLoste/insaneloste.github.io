<p>Users possess a lung capacity at a transcendent and limitless level, allowing them to hold their breath indefinitely, inhale/exhale forever, suck in anything/everything without having to worry about stopping, survive <a href="/wiki/Deoxygenation" title="Deoxygenation">Deoxygenation</a>, and being capable of potentially cause hurricanes and much worse with merely the force of the user's breathing. This places the user above practically any and all other beings in their respective multiverse with their transcendent lung and/or breathing capacity.
