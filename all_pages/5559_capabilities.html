<p>Users can increase their own physical and spiritual prowess via a negative supernatural affliction they have, this power usually activates when the user exhibits strong negative emotion or distress. As the user masters the power, the negative effects of the mystical affliction become less apparent as the victim's body becomes more assimilated to the curse. When the curse or affliction is removed from the user their powers will disappear until the curse is re-initiated.
