<p>Users of this power can take on the powers of the Blue Men of the Minch or are a member of this species. The Blue Men are a unique sea-demon found in Scottish folklore who inhabit a stretch of ocean known as the Minch. While they are known as "storm-kelpies," they rarely, if ever, appear as horses and are instead, depicted as blue-skinned men, often elderly, who will bob and sway in the sea like a porpoise.
