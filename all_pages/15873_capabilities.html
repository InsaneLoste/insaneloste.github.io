<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate modes, specialized states and/or transformations that enable particular abilities or other attributes and traits, usually aimed at addressing and managing specific entities, environments or circumstances. Through such control, one can manifest unique techniques to alter oneself or even others. One can imbue a target with the ability to enter into specific modes. The user can alter that nature of an individualâ€™s current state to help or hinder their particular situation (enhancement, diminution, etc.). One could even activate an inherent mode control ability within a target. Control over modes enables one to command inherent adaptability and survival capability in whatever targets one chooses, including the user.
