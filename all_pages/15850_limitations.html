<ul><li>Since cells can only divide so many times under normal circumstances, accelerating mitosis is to shorten one's life unless one can remove the limit (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Telomere_Regeneration" title="Telomere Regeneration">regrow telomeres</a>).</li>
<li>If user has cancer, accelerating its mitosis would speed up its progression.</li>
<li>Slowing down mitosis to decelerate aging may cause wounds to close at a slower rate.</li>
<li>Accelerating mitosis may cause malnutrition as cells require nutrients to divide.</li></ul>
