<p>Users become the embodiment of time. Users gain the power to control the timeline of all things whether to fast forward things or rewind them. The user can cause anything to rot, corrode, decay and turn to dust, or reverse things to the past to the point in which they have never existed. They can travel in time, and read, manipulate and remember past, present and future timelines/events.
