<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into aÂ <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dhampir" title="wikipedia:Dhampir">dhampir</a>, a vampire/human hybrid, which in most cases has all the strengths that a normal vampire has without any of the weaknesses. Blood is still a factor in most cases, either they need to feed because they will die, or they simply are weakened when they don't feed and according to Wikipedia Dhampir sometimes don't even need Blood to operate and can eat normal human food. Some dhampirs can subsist on either blood or human food. Whatever the case, just like with vampires, the quantity of blood a dhampir needs will vary greatly. Their resistance to sunlight varies as well; some may be weakened by it, while others are completely immune to its effects. Another thing to note is that Dhampir's blood seems acidic to their vampire counterparts.
