<p>The user can alter the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Physical_fitness" title="wikipedia:Physical fitness">physical fitness</a> of themselves or others. Users may convert Olympic athletes into weak and obese individuals, or transform skinny-armed weaklings into muscle-bound tough-guys. Users can even shift a bulky power lifter into a lean marathon runner (or vice versa), shifting the nature of the target's fitness. This power is not just manipulating fat and muscle; it can enhance or degrade all aspects of physical fitness including <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiovascular_fitness" title="wikipedia:Cardiovascular fitness">cardiovascular fitness</a>, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardiorespiratory_fitness" title="wikipedia:Cardiorespiratory fitness">cardiorespiratory fitness</a>, strength, and endurance.
