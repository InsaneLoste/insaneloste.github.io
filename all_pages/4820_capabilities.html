<p>The user is able to compute insight into a situation, the answer to a problem, the future, the present, the past, someoneâ€™s thoughts and motives, navigational information, a single moment/instant/bit, etc. This is all achieved through pure computation without occult or supernatural means, practices, or phenomenon, and doesn't even necessarily require the need/ability to search for the answer elsewhere, as the user can calculate/compute/extrapolate it themselves based on currently available and known information.
