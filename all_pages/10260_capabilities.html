<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate the forge of creation, a supernatural, divine, often primordial object, environment or realm that acts as the metaphysical workspace for creating fundamental components of existence, often accomplished by an archetypal crafter/creator. It is used for the literal forging of aspects like lifeforms, concepts, worlds or even entire universes. The overall complexity of the creations often depends on the artistic skills of the supernatural smith. Even if one does not actually use it to craft something, the sheer might of the forge can grant one incredible abilities, as it is literally a wellspring for the conceptual power of creation.
