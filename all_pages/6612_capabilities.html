<p>The user can copy the powers of others but at a weaker level compared to the original, whether by lacking the original's strength, the power being more costly, only copying a fragment of the power, having less potential than the original, etc. This results in the user having to rely on skill and creativity, rather than brute strength or overwhelming force to achieve success with the copied power.
