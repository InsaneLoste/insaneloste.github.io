<p>The user can actively alter/change the powers of oneself or others to whatever ability they desire. The change may be controllable, or random, making the ability change to any random power. If the user's targets have multiple abilities, the user can change the secondary powers as well. With this ability, the user is also able to add rules to the skills that <i><b>have</b></i> to be followed and the abilities they offer. (For example, the opponent/victim power rules can be based on the time, recharging, proximity, <a href="/wiki/Dependency" title="Dependency">dependency</a>, have <a href="/wiki/Trait:Aversion" title="Trait:Aversion">aversions</a> to certain things etc.)
