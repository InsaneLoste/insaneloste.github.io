<p>The user is an infinite-dimensional entity who exists in infinite-dimensional function spaces or embodies infinite-dimensional structures. The user's dimensional/structural size would be equivalent to a countably infinite or higher levels of infinity, usually represented in fiction by endless hierarchies of layers of existence, each succeeding one completely trivializing the previous into insignificance, or more generally a space with either a countably or uncountably infinite set of dimensions.
