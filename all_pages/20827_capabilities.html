<p>Users can manipulate radio waves and frequencies as well as things that use radio waves, such as AM and FM waves, TV radio waves/frequencies as well as waves/frequencies from cell phones, AM or FM radio, radar, and so on. With this power, one can make a television show something else (Like making the Newscaster look like someone else) or change the sounds coming from a radio to something different.
