<p>Users can utterly destroy things. Depending on the user, this could be anything and everything from small objects to entire galaxies or universes and possibly even abstract concepts and/or natural forces/laws. Notably, users of this power still have limits - if they lack any limits then this would be an example of <a href="/wiki/Absolute_Destruction" title="Absolute Destruction">Absolute Destruction</a>. What those exact limits are will depend on the user. If the user is able to remove something completely and utterly without leaving anything behind, it may instead be a form of <a href="/wiki/Erasure" title="Erasure">Erasure</a>.
