<p>The users with this trait can take on the abilities of a Obariyon or are one, a Obariyon is a small spirit from Japanese folklore similar to an imp that will attack travelers by hopping onto their back and demand them to give them a piggyback - they will continually increase their weight when doing so while also biting at a victim's scalp repeatedly, if a victim fails to take the spirit to its desired location they either collapse from exhaustion or are crushed by the spirit however if one succeeds in bringing the spirit to a desired spot it will leave and bestow a large sack of money, granting the former victim wealth enough to keep them rich for the rest of their life.
