<p>The user can do an indefinitely amount of dashes one after another without stopping. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Multi-Acceleration" title="Multi-Acceleration">Multi-Acceleration</a>, this power does not specify what direction the user goes in, and is just speed, which is in short bursts rather than long ones. It also does not have a limit to how many dashes one can do.
