<p>Users become a physical personification or manifestation of the temptation of man that brings them down and gain power from temptations and seductions of others and oneself as well as the very concept of Evil. Users can use sins as a power source to extend their life span, use it as a weapon or cause others to temptation/be evil, it can also be displayed by their physical, spiritual forms. The user can be tempted by anything they want and can also augment their inducements on a victim until they are rendered completely insane or dead.
