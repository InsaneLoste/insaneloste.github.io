<p>User is made up of or can transform their body completely into brass. Users transformed form can be anatomically identical to their normal form, aside from being made of brass, in which case it contains all organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
