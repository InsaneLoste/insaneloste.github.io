<p>User can call on the minds of others living, dead, or in another world, communicating with a past life, a deceased ancestor, or to receive help from a living friend. This power may be limited to which people the user may communicate with or how often they may communicate or in what state the user is in when communicating. This ability covers a wide range of mental communication. Evocation pulls the mind of another into the mind of the users, allowing them to communicate whether or not they would normally have the ability to.
