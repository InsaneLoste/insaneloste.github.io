<p>The user is made up of or can transform their body completely into copper. A user's transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside from being made of copper, in which case it contains all organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
