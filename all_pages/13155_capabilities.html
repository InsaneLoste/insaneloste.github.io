<p>User can create, shape and manipulate the space or time between times, or between events and timelines, allowing them to affect time, events and alternate timelines in many ways. This allows them to do things like collapse the time between events to erase things from existence, change the duration between times, affect the boundary between timelines, and likely much more.
