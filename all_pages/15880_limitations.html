<li>User's genetics may be unstable, resulting in <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Double-Edged_Power" title="Double-Edged Power">side effects</a> such as:
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Accelerated_Aging" title="Accelerated Aging">Accelerated Aging</a>: The people who engineered the clone would give the clones a limited lifespan to prevent possible uprisings against their creator.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Infertility_Inducement" title="Infertility Inducement">Infertility</a>: The people who engineered the clone could engineer the clone's genetic with terminator genes, preventing the clone from procreating or even being cloned.</li>
<li><a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Emotionlessness" title="Emotionlessness">Emotionlessness</a>: The clones can be engineered to possess no sense of human emotions and thus be nothing more than a biological weapon.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Necrosis_Inducement" title="Necrosis Inducement">Self-Necrosis</a>: The clone's physiology could be unstable to the point of death by breaking down via necrosis/decaying, causing them to painfully be dying out.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Divided_Mind" title="Divided Mind">Multiple personalities</a>: A clone might possess the personality of the person they were clones from as well as their personality traits at the same time.</li></ul></li>
