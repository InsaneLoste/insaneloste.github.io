<p>The user either is or can transform into a wereavian. A wereavian is a person that has the ability to shapeshift into an avian-like humanoid, or possibly even into a bird entirely. Alternate forms may possess many mixtures of human and bird traits (ex. head and torso of a man; wings and talons of a bird; etc.).
