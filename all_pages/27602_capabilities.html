<p>The user can manipulate gravity by tilting the world around oneself, either literally or by illusion. They can tilt the world so a flat surface becomes a slope, flip the world so the ground is above them, move the ground on the side, walls downward to be walked on, move the world so they appear to be going faster/in the other direction, etc.
