<p>The user can control self-generated chemical reactions. They can also manipulate the reactions already happening inside of them. By channeling the energies driving said processes outward, this allows them to manipulate matter and energy in various ways. This includes control over activation energy, thermochemistry, electrochemistry, photochemistry, and much more.
