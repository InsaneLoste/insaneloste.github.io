<p>The user can utilize the Force-Field Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around flyrokinetic power. Force-fields are generally understood to be an energetically and/or forcefully potent means of defense. Their main use has been to prevent harm to the wielders. Though normally limited to personally protective purposes, users can, through specialized training, learn to wield their force-fields in unique ways. At basic levels, barriers can be manipulated in terms of size, shape and durability. They can even be created with multiple layers, adding to their fortitude. With more practice, they can be generated to surround specific targets other than the wielders themselves, creating a remote form of protection or even a specialized prison. The energy/force can be used to create different types of constructs like weapons, be extended for projected attacks and even create reflective or destructive effects. The best users can cause their force-fields to create unique supernatural abilities aside from defense, reflection or combat, including but not limited to personal power augmentation, healing, detection, transportation and absorption.
