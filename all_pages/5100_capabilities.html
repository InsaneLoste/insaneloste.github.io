<p>Users can raise the dead into a different type of creature (<a href="/wiki/Demonization" title="Demonization">demons</a>, <a href="/wiki/Vampirization" title="Vampirization">vampires</a>,<a href="/wiki/Lycanthropic_Infection" title="Lycanthropic Infection"> werewolves</a>, <a href="/wiki/Humanization" title="Humanization">humans</a>, etc.) or (rarely) a <a href="/wiki/Hybridization" title="Hybridization">hybrid</a>, usually the one they are themselves part of. While the revived creatures retain most of their original traits, they also undergo a physical and mental transformation, gaining additional abilities and traits relatives to their new nature, as well as a sire bond to the user.
