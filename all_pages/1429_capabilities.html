<p>User can create, shape and manipulate anti or negative forces, which work in different ways depending on the force. Anti-gravity would repel objects instead of attract, anti-electromagnetism would cause like charges to attract and opposite charges to repel, anti-friction and anti-viscosity would speed up objects or flow instead of resist them, anti-strong force would cause nuclei to explode, and anti-weak force would cause "radioactive growth" instead of radioactive decay.
