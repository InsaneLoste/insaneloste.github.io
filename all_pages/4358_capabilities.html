In the 19th century folklorists believed that it had once been the cruel custom to bury a dog alive under the cornerstone of a church as a foundation sacrifice so that its ghost might serve as it's guardian. During funerals the presiding priest may see the grim looking on from a church tower as the creature determines from its post whether the soul of the deceased is destined for Heaven, or Hell. The grim inhabits the churchyard day and night and is associated with dark stormy weather.
