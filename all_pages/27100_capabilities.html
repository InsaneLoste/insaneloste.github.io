<p>Users of this power can take on the traits of Water Hags or are one, a Water Hag is a type of legendary creature from multiple world folklores and fantasy, like all hags they are similar to witches but are considered spirits of nature rather than evil-minded mortals (though as time progressed the two inevitably became mixed, much as many ancient gods and fairies became demons under the rule of the early church).  A Water Hag has control over a region of water, often dangerous or remote areas such as certain parts of the ocean, rivers or streams and acted as a warning not to stray too near such hazardous areas.  A classic example of such a spirit is Jenny Greentooth, who was envisioned as a monstrous witch who would inhabit streams and rivers, especially those prone to having dangerous weeds and debris, which could easily snag unwary children - as such Jenny was imagined to have long arms with deadly claws by which she would drag children into the water and drown them, much as weeds would do.. this is an example of how the Water Hag, like many bogeymen, was as much a symbol of real-world dangers as a creature.. often embodying the darker side of water (which while vital for human life was also one of the main reasons of human death when not treated with due respect).
