<p>Users can create, shape and otherwise manipulate all forms of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Calcium" title="wikipedia:Calcium">calcium</a>, a naturally abundant (fifth most abundant by mass) metallic element, which appears as a soft gray alkaline earth metal. Calcium is essential for living organisms, in particular in cell physiology, where movement of the calcium ion Ca<sup>2+</sup> into and out of the cytoplasm functions as a signal for many cellular processes. As a major material used in mineralization of bone, teeth and shells, calcium is the most abundant metal by mass in many animals.
