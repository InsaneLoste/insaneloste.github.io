<p>Users of this ability can utilize science (or pseudo-science) to reverse the extinction of a species or even several. However, unlike true extinction reversal, often the results are mixed and thus while a species may appear to be revived, they are usually altered in some fashion. This can be slight (meaning the species is almost identical to the previous extinct one) or extremely dramatic (for example Uplifting a species to reverse an extinction).
