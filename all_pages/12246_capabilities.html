<p>The user can reverse their direction of motion more easily and more quickly than what others can do. This does not have to be a straight reverse, but it can be in any direction opposite to the user's motion so long as it is in the opposite direction. This is a power because it is difficult to reverse, especially at high speeds for a given acceleration, which is made less by the mass, or inertia of anyone or anything like the user. At normal human strength at high speeds, it would take long to stop and then reverse one's motion. This can also be used for making turns that require reverses.
