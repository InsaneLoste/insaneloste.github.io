<p>The user can ignore friction, which would normally affect speed and resist motion, allowing them to accelerate and go faster while maintaining a grip on the surface and move normally. They can run on surfaces with less or no friction such as ice without slipping and falling over. They can even fit through tight spaces easily without getting stuck, and they can ignore sliding friction, rolling friction as well as static friction and kinetic friction.
