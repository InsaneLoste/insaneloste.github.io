<p>The user can rely on the quantum mechanics principal of something being capable of being in two or more states simultaneously until observed (simplified to the "<a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Schr%C3%B6dinger's_cat" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Schr√∂dinger's cat</a>" thought experiment by Erwin Schrodinger) to effectively exist in all unobserved points at once, only existing in a specific point when observed. In practice, it would seem to be the power to <a href="/wiki/Instant_Transmission" title="Instant Transmission">instantly teleport</a> between any unobserved points, and simply <a href="/wiki/Imperceptibility" title="Imperceptibility">disappear</a> when not observed.
