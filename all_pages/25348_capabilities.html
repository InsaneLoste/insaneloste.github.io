<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(yarn)" title="wikipedia:Thread (yarn)">threads</a> and <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String" title="wikipedia:String">string</a>, long, thin and flexible form of material. Most commonly, users can generate them and use them to control the movements of people and manipulate their movements akin to how a puppeteer controls puppet. Users can also move threads telekinetically or use them to move other objects. Depending on their tensile strength and durability, thread manipulation can be used as a thin and stealthy weapon to slice up enemies or cut through objects with ease. Moreover, they can shape string into weapons, such as whips and swords, or use them to form shields or traps to bind their opponents and immobilize them.
