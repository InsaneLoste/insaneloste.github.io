<p>The user is a were-rabbit, a giant monstrous rabbit of greatly enhanced strength, speed, agility and durability. Usually, a were-rabbit is a human who has been cursed under certain circumstances to transform into their monstrous, feral form under the moon or other situations. They gain various enhancements along with the transformation but may lose out their rationalities to the beast. Other times, however, the person may transform into a were-rabbit at will, or even start out as a purebred one.
