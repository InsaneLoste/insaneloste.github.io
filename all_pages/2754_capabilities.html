<p>User can create, shape, and manipulate bio-generated magma. They can channel their properties inside and around them including, but not limited to, geothermal (heat and temperature), transitional states, density, volatility, etc. This, in turn, makes them a walking biological volcano. The user can even generate and control the elements that compose magma such as earth, fire, and their energies.
