<p>User can counter anything including events, powers, choices, creations/destruction etc., in a number of ways, from gaining counter abilities (IE. Enemy uses fire, you can use water) to wiping out an entire army, just to protect their interests.Â They may be tied to the whims of the granter of these powers, may be a god themselves, and unable to pick and choose, or chose to be used by the Counter-Force, or maybe even be the Counter-Force itself.
