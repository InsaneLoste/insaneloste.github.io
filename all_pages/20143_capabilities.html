<p>The user can utilize the Propulsion Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around propulsive power. Propulsion comes about through the expulsion of energy and/or matter, allowing one to achieve locomotive capabilities. While this kind of power is normally associated with simple transportation, there are specialized techniques one can gain through unique training that take advantage of the forces/materials involved. Practices can include channeling the expelled energy/matter to create projected attacks, using the force created to enhance oneâ€™s speed, agility and physical strikes and even achieving feats like self-propelled flight. While usually utilized as a unidirectional practice, one can learn to unleash said power from any body part for any number of purposes, such as creating a protective barrier. The user need only learn to master whatever element or substance they wield.
