<p>User can collapse any/all possibilities and variables, preventing them being changed or affected by any other power. This can cause things that would normally happen to become impossible to happen, prevent variables from being altered/changed in any way, negate or prevent events from happening by collapsing the possibility of them occurring, make attacks unavoidable/unblockable by preventing the possibility of them being evaded or blocked and even prevent powers like <a href="/wiki/Quantum_Uncertainty" title="Quantum Uncertainty">uncertainty</a> by collapsing the possibility of existing in two different states.
