<p>User can manipulate music without any limit, allowing them to manipulate the world and beyond as if it were simply a theme/notes/verse of a song along with its aspects. They can create epics through their music/musical themes and can control the principles of the world they create or live in, along with the infinite possibilities. Allowing them to view the world as a singular grand/great song that all things are mere notes, tones, or harmonies in.
