<p>The user can use this power in two ways: if used on a non-living object or energy, it will be separated into multiple pieces as if a net-like laser slashed through it. If used on a living being, the being will either be separated into smaller versions of themselves or living pieces (See <a href="/wiki/Non-Lethal_Damage" title="Non-Lethal Damage">Non-Lethal Damage</a>). User is able to reverse the effects if they choose to do so.
