<p>Users can block damage at will, making it so that damage to parts of the body does not spread and thus does not get worse as in damaged further when the user is struck by someone or something in the same area that is damaged. This can make it so the user or the target does not suffer the effects of the damage that they have any more beyond the point this power was used. For example, if a person's rib cage was damaged, thus power could be used to prevent any further damage to it from happening.
