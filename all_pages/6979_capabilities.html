<p>The user can use a systematic method to track down/locate people, objects, and resources without using scientific apparatus. Dowsing can also be used to track organic life through specific things they've touched. Dowsing is treated like a science by most of its members, claiming that the ability to dowse is simply the ability to detect the presence of bends in sonic vibrations coming from geothermal phenomena at the center of the earth. They believe that through navigating and tracking vibration bends they can find objects and even through advanced detection, sense the presence of opprotunistic events to appear "lucky" to outside observers. .
