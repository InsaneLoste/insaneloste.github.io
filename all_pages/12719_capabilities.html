<p>The user can operate and function without inertia. Normally with zero/little inertia, object would be easily accelerated and stopped by any force and would stop soon after the force is exerted unless it is constantly applied, making attacks, jumps and movements ineffective. With this power, user can move/attack as if they had effective inertia/momentum and thus move and attack like they would normally.
