<p>User's five senses (<a href="/wiki/Peak_Human_Hearing" title="Peak Human Hearing">hearing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peak_Human_Smell" title="Peak Human Smell">smell</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peak_Human_Taste" title="Peak Human Taste">taste</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peak_Human_Touch" title="Peak Human Touch">touch</a> and <a href="/wiki/Peak_Human_Vision" title="Peak Human Vision">vision</a>) are pushed to the highest limits of human perfection. Individuals with this ability are capable of seeing further, having 20/5 vision meaning they can see something clearly from 20 feet away what others have to see at 5 feet away, and able to see in complete darkness, ultraviolet and infrared light, acutely touching ink on a page and feel anotherâ€™s breathing, pulse and heartbeat as well as sense the vibrations of others close to your vicinity without having to physically touch them.
