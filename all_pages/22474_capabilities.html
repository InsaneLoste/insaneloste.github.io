<p>User can create, shape and manipulate <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silicon" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">silicon</a>, a tetravalent metalloid, pure silicon is crystalline, a gray in color and a metallic luster. It is rather strong, very brittle, prone to chipping and, like carbon and germanium, crystallizes in a diamond cubic crystal structure. It is highly reactive, readily either donating or sharing its four outer electrons, allowing for many forms of chemical bonding.
