<p>The user can bypass/negate the <a href="/wiki/Intangibility" title="Intangibility">Intangibility</a> or fluid-like nature of beings to deal damage to them. This ability allows the user to harm beings with a fluid-like, gas-like, or any other malleable form that normally would allow them to be unharmed by conventional physical attacks. This bypass can also be transferred/imbued into objects such as weapons to assist the user in combat.
