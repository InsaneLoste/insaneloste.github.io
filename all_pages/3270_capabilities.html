<p>The user can change parts of their body with other body-part or with a object. For example, the user can turn their hand into a drill, gun or a wrench or turn their leg into a wheel, or a head into a periscope. These things are usually stored inside the user's body, and the method of changing can be done via shapeshifting body parts or retracting body parts in and replacing them with a different body part or object/weapon.
