The hunting grounds of the Cŵn Annwn are said to include the mountain of Cadair Idris, where it is believed the howling of these huge dogs foretold death to any living being who heard them. Their growling is loudest when they are at a distance, and as they draw nearer, it grows softer and softer. The coming of these bests is generally seen as a death omen.
