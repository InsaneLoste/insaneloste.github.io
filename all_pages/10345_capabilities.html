<p>The user can manipulate the concepts of unfreedom/freedom, or things and people's range of freedom, so is the unfreedom that comes from restricting said leisures and is the freedom that is emerge from losing said restrictions. They could enslave people or take away people's freedoms, or subject them to different laws or rules. The same could be to alleviate the restrictions or stipulations coming from this, thus freeing them. This power is essentially the balance between two dichotomic concepts, allowing the user to manipulate one and the other, as they cannot exist without the other.
