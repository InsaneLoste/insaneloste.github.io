<p>The user has the ability to move, attack and act by bending body parts even if they have become hard. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Stiff_Movement" title="Stiff Movement">Stiff Movement</a>, which has the user's whole body and its parts not bend or flex when moving, this power makes it so that the user bend his body parts even if they are made of metal, stone, etc.
