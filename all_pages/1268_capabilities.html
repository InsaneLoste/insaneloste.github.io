<p>The user can control over the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum" title="wikipedia:Angular momentum">angular momentum</a>, which is proportional to the moment of inertia (or rotational mass) and angular velocity, and if one goes up, the other goes down. So decreasing rotational mass increases angular velocity and vice versa. This can be used to affect both the moment of inertia and the angular velocity combined to alter angular momentum.
