<p>The user is a protector and keeper of the multiverse. Unlike <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Multiversal_Physiology" title="Multiversal Physiology">Multiversal Physiology</a>, the user doesn't become the multiverse, but merely a protector that oversees it and is in charge of keeping it stable.
