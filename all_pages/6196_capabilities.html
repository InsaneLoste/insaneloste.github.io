<p>Users can acquire power from demonic forces. Often, they're cursed with the evil from unholy items, spirits, or concepts. Sometimes their bodies are warped and twisted into a hellish parody of their previous state, becoming demons. Some can switch in and out of their new forms at will. Those who are too weak to control the power will lose their sanity as well as their souls.
