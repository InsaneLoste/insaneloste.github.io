<p>The user can remove, reverse, or take away the anthropomorphic properties and physiology of targets, who have animalistic and organic counterparts. The species of the target stays the same, though their anthropomorphic abilities, traits, and properties are reversed or removed. This power often makes the target lose all of their anthropomorphic abilities, which could affect other powers that target had if those powers are dependent on the target's anthropomorphism.
