<p>The user is able to apply incredible force to their feet, enabling them to deliver a supernatural stomp. While this term has been used to describe many supernatural stomps, the true megaton stomp is packed with <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent#Kiloton_and_megaton" title="wikipedia:TNT equivalent">4.18 petajoules of energy</a>. That megaton stomp delivered to a typical human would result in complete obliteration of the body. The effect of a megaton stomp is comparable to a directed nuclear explosion or a supernatural cannon. Users can kick through battle tank armor, smash down powerful fortress walls, and leave massive craters in the earth. Supernatural damage aside, a user must hold supernatural power to control this attack because, by <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Newton%27s_laws_of_motion" title="wikipedia:Newton's laws of motion">Newton's third law</a>, delivering this stomp should accelerate a 200 lbs user to over 6,000 km/s, exceeding <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity" title="wikipedia:Escape velocity">escape velocity</a> and launching them on a direction permanently away from earth.
