<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hula" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">hula</a>, a Polynesian dance developed on the Hawaiian Islands that dramatizes or portrays the words of songs and stories in a visual dance form. There are many sub-styles of hula, with the main two categories being Hula ʻAuana and Hula Kahiko. Ancient hula, as performed before Western encounters with Hawaiʻi, is called kahiko. It is accompanied by chant and traditional instruments. Hula, as it evolved under Western influence in the 19th and 20th centuries, is called ʻauana (a word that means "to wander" or "drift").
