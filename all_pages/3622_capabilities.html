<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a bwbachod, a household brownie-goblin trickster spirit who represents or is associated with not only with playing tricks on others but also households of others if they are invoked. The bwbachod will always be on the side of the one who summons them and helping them around the house and on their lands, however, to treat these spirits badly or forget to give them the one things they want in return for doing all the work for you which is dairy products, mainly fresh cream and butter; they will turn against their summoner and make their lives and living hell until they are treated right again. They also can't tell the difference between friend or foes that enter the home and have been known to play tricks on the wrong types of people that enter the home.
