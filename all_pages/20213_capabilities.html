<p>User can perform <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pseudoscience" title="wikipedia:Pseudoscience">pseudoscience</a>, methodology that appears to be scientific or supported by science, but which fails to comply with the scientific method. A field, practice or body of knowledge can reasonably be called pseudo-scientific when it is presented as consistent with scientific research, but it demonstrably fails to meet scientific norms.
