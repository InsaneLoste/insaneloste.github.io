<p>The user can dive effectively and better than most of their species. Diving is a form of descent, and can be used whether by flying or falling, usually with some maneuverability. They may not take damage when landing, and they can use this to do dive attacks on enemies. This is done in the down direction, but can be used in other directions as well if the current conditions allow for it.
