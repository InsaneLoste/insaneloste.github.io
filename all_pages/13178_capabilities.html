<p>Users can intuitively sense energy from other people to the extent of absorbing it into their own body and feel the same intense emotions. This power works on a purely instinctual level: users donâ€™t have the usual filters as <a href="/wiki/Empathy" title="Empathy">empathy</a>, but spontaneously adopt to other's emotions, physical sensations, and psychological perspectives in their bodies making it more of an inherent part of themselves than an external ability. Thus, being able to put themselves into someone else's place without necessarily engaging with their emotions. Making this power a very useful skill particularly enabling them to see other's perspectives in negotiation or management. Allowing them to archive the best opportunities in life and deal with situations in the most efficient manner. With training and awareness, users can sense the subtle energy of others therefore they have advantages for avoiding the strong influence of energy from those around their position.
