<p>The character is a modified clone/copy of another being. They are an altered genetic duplicate who was created through scientific or magical means, or through other forms of <a href="/wiki/Replication" title="Replication">Replication</a> or <a href="/wiki/Self-Replication" title="Self-Replication">Self-Replication</a> power. Unlike doppelg√§ngers, the character was created as a copy of another being and is not simply imitating/mimicking another being. Unlike multipresent clones, the character is a unique being with their own consciousness and soul. Clones will usually have the same <a href="/wiki/Category:Physiology" title="Category:Physiology">physiology</a> as the being from which they are duplicated, but they have been altered in some way. Often the modifications are to make them superior to the original being or to optimize them for a particular task/function. Some modified clones are considered to be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Superior_Human_Physiology" title="Superior Human Physiology">meta-humans</a> or <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Super_Soldier" title="Archetype:Super Soldier">super soldiers</a>.
