<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate solar forces of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Solar Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiments of suns themselves. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Solar Manipulation as the sun is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunity to solar based abilities.
