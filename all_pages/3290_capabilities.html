<p>A user with this trait can take on the abilities of a Boggart or is one. A <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Boggart" title="wikipedia:Boggart">boggart</a> is a troublesome spirit from English folklore that can vary from a household spirit akin to a hobgoblin or a genius loci linked to swamps, fields or other localized areas. The boggart is infamous for playing tricks on humans, often loving to scare and prank them; sometimes boggarts are cruel and will harm humans but usually they prefer to cause mischief rather than malice. This is not always the case however, and some Boggarts engage in much more malevolent acts such as kidnapping and killing children. As such, Boggarts are linked strongly with the Bogeyman and in many ways helped inspire the popular image of said Bogeyman in popular culture.
