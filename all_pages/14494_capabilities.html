<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lucha_libre" title="wikipedia:Lucha libre">lucha libre</a>, a style of Mexican professional wrestling. Practitioners execute high flying attacks by using the wrestling ring's ropes to catapult themselves towards their opponents, using intricate combinations in rapid-fire succession, and applying complex submission holds. Lucha libre is traditionally more agile and performs more aerial maneuvers than professional wrestlers in the United States, who more often rely on power and hard strikes.
