<p>The user can manipulate any paradox or anything that beyond common sense or logic; an unexplained phenomenon, something that exists or happens when it logically shouldn't. With this power, users are maybe able to ignore the rules of reality when being used at its highest level of power. This power allows them to achieve a wide variety of feats through the manipulation of 'paradoxes' (the phenomenon itself) and achieve anything paradoxical in nature. The application of this power can be quite irrational to onlookers, never making any sense on how the user is accomplishing such feats.
