<p>Users can control and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Time" title="wikipedia:Time">time</a>, the indefinite continued progress of existence and events that occur in an apparently irreversible succession from the <a href="/wiki/Past_Manipulation" title="Past Manipulation">past</a>, through the <a href="/wiki/Present_Manipulation" title="Present Manipulation">present</a>, into the <a href="/wiki/Future_Manipulation" title="Future Manipulation">future</a>, in the general area or for a specific target in various ways, with the most basic of acts revolving around accelerating, slowing, stopping, and even rewinding or looping it. The range of the affected area is proportional to the mastery of the user, with those at higher levels being able affect the entire <a href="/wiki/Space-Time_Manipulation" title="Space-Time Manipulation">space-time continuum</a>.
