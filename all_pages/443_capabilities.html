<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate action-reaction forces, which are a part of Newton's third law of motion. They can change the direction and magnitude each force is exerting on one another, making the user be able to fly, not to sink in quicksand, or otherwise be able to go a different direction other than the one they are supposed to go.
