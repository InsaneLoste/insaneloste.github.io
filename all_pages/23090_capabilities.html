<p>The user can materialize a soul (the immaterial attribute of a living and/or sentient being) and/or have a materialized soul, materializing soul into a tangible state instead of its normal conceptual and formless state. The materialized soul is immortal, so it's able to live on after the physical body dies. If the user can also materialize another person's soul, it's useful to save someone whose physical body has died so the soul will not become lost.
