<ul><li>Energy may be limited by proximity between poles and/or magnet and attractive materials.</li>
<li>Strong magnetic fields could disrupt userâ€™s control.</li>
<li>May require the presence of some medium (like ferrous materials) to user power.</li>
<li>Extreme heat could cause loss of magnetism, thus negating energy.</li>
<li>The amount of energy produced depends on the magnetic field's strength and orientation of and distance between poles.</li></ul>
