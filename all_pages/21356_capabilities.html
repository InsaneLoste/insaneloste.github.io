<p>The user is immortal in the sense that when they do die, they won't <i>stay</i> dead. This could be the result of <a href="/wiki/Self-Resurrection" title="Self-Resurrection">instant resurrection</a>, being <a href="/wiki/Reincarnation" title="Reincarnation">reborn</a>, transferring one's mind/soul <a href="/wiki/Immortal_Cloning" title="Immortal Cloning">into a clone</a>, etc. The user can still die from various causes, like physical trauma, but the user will always come back to life.
