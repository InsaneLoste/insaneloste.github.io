<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate their own optical phenomena. They either possess or can manifest some inherent matter/light interaction occurrence (auroras, halos, mirages, rainbows, etc.) that can have various effects. They can range from simply creating visual phenomena to disguising appearances to potentially causing harm through concentrated photon emissions.
