<p>The users of this power are able to create a field that can push an object that is around them away from themselves. Unlike regular <a href="/wiki/Attraction_%26_Repulsion" title="Attraction &amp; Repulsion">attraction &amp; repulsion</a>, the field provides little to no precise control over what they push away from its center, and oftentimes is unable to accurately push singular or specific items or even how much force is applied to the object, which can lead to some objects being violently repelled from the user. Instead, they push things away from them from a certain radius, with size and mass being more of a factor.
