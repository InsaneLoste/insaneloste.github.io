<p>The user possesses a decreased effectiveness against specific types of entities, objects, elements, terrains, etc., causing anything that user does against that thing to be, in a general or specific way, much less effective than against any other type of thing. In practice this means that against that thing the user: may deal less damage, have effects they apply last shorter, find its defenses are more effective, may not bypass its defenses altogether, have things work harder, may spend more resources, etc.
