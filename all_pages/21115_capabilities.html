<p>User can create, shape and manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_thread_of_fate" title="wikipedia:Red thread of fate">red string of fate</a>, an invisible conceptual string that bonds soulmates together. They can create limitless amounts of red strings and extend them at any distance; the strings never tear apart, as they are practically indestructible. They can make the red strings become visible and touchable for others, and also choose and change anyone's soulmate; they can control the relationship of those bonded by the strings or even completely remove their bond.
