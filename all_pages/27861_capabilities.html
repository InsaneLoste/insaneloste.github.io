<p>The user is a zombified alien, an alien with the aptitudes of an undead creature. These creatures are either created through <a href="/wiki/Evolution" title="Evolution">natural evolution</a>, <a href="/wiki/Subordination_Manipulation" title="Subordination Manipulation">contagious DNA altering pathogens/parasites/spores</a>, or through supernatural means. Zombified aliens can use the abilities of both a zombie (enhanced body, self-sufficient) and an alien (advanced bodily composition, adaptation) though it depends.
