<p>The user can effectively parachute to slow their motion in the air. This may include falling or moving in any direction. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Fall_Breaking" title="Fall Breaking">Fall Breaking</a>, which is normally done one time in the air or when landing, this ability is continuous once the power is in effect. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Slow_Descent" title="Slow Descent">Slow Descent</a>, this can be used in any direction of motion. This power can also be used when doing things like running on the ground to slow one's running.
