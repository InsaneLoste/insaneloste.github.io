<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bakeneko" title="wikipedia:Bakeneko">bakeneko</a> (changed cat), a cat y≈çkai with supernatural abilities. All bakeneko (unless they are born from two bakeneko) start as a normal cat that becomes a bakeneko in a number of ways: they may reach a certain age, be kept for a certain number of years, grow to a certain size, or be allowed to keep a long tail. While their other form is an unusually large cat with forked or doubled tail (usually only nekomatas) and ability to walk upright, they are able to change their shape. They are also known for holding grudges and haunting the houses they dwell in.
