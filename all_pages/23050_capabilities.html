<p>User is able to create/manifest/summon unique powers as physical extension that's apart of their soul. The extension that are apart of their soul may be manifested as a weapon, an armor, unique energy, an entity, etc. Each is likely to have their own abilities and powers they grant to the user, but these depend on which part of the user's soul they represent as well as the abilities/powers they already have.
