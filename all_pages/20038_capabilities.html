<p>The user can equalize the probability, changing all probabilities to a complete 50/50, creating a complete and utter equilibrium at the probabilistic level. Due to nature being ruled by probability at the most fundamental level, this power essentially allows the user to make practically anything happen, but these things are equally as likely to go wrong for the user as they are to go right.
