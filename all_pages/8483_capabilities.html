<p>The user is completely immune to any and all <a href="/wiki/Category:Void_Powers" title="Category:Void Powers">void</a> and erasing abilities making them <i>completely and totally inerasable</i>, protecting their whole existence against even the most <a href="/wiki/Oblivion_Embodiment" title="Oblivion Embodiment">dire kind</a> of <a href="/wiki/Absolute_Erasure" title="Absolute Erasure">nonexistence</a>. They are essentially inerasable to the point that they don't rely on a source or field of existence to reside in but they totally self-contain their own existence no matter what state they are in whether they are <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Absolute_Health" title="Absolute Health">healthy</a>, damaged, alive or <a href="/wiki/Undead_Physiology" title="Undead Physiology">dead</a>, <a href="/wiki/Amortality" title="Amortality">amortal</a> and so on. This means that even if there will be <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Totality_Collapse" title="Totality Collapse">no existence left</a> they will keep on like nothing has happened.
