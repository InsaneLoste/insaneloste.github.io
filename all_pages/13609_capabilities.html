<p>Users with this trait can take on the abilities of a Kishi or are one, a Kishi is an African demon that is stated to be a human (usually male) with a hyena face on the back of their head, while the hyena head is a ravenous monster that devours anything it can the human face is a cunning and ruthless predator that seduces and tricks victims, together the two entities work as one as a supernatural predator and man-eaterÂ : despite the human-like appearance of the spirit it is not of the mortal world, nor has ever truly been part of it, indeed the name Kishi is roughly translated as "spirit".
