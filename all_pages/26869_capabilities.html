<p>The user can create, alter, and destroy virtual realities within computer systems to simulate real or fictional environments, locations, and/or events. Users can manipulate the virtual reality while it is running. They may be able to employ this power using only their mind or they may need to do it by interfacing through a computer system. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Virtual_Warping" title="Virtual Warping">Virtual Warping</a>, this power only influences inside a simulated/virtual environment and it does not manipulate actual reality.
