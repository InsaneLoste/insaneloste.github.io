<p>The user is or has the abilities of a Locust of Abaddon, a biblical beast described in the Book of Revelation. It has a human-like face, the teeth of a lion, the body of a locust, the tail and sting of a scorpion, and long hair. Its venom can torment a human being for months, driving it to desire death. The noise of its wings is similar to the sound of numerous chariots in battle.
