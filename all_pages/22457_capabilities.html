<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate any sort of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sign" title="wikipedia:Sign">sign</a>, like store signs and road signs. This allows the user to do things such as signs that point someone in the right direction, signs that tell where something is or what something is, signs that tell how fast one should go, and so on.
