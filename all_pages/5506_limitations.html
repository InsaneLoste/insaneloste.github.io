<li>May not be able to retract the wings.</li>
<li>The user's wings may not be built for flying, instead only for gliding.</li>
<li>Needs enough thrust and lift, so the size/condition of wings and the thickness of air are obvious problems to overcome.</li>
<li>Flight-ceiling depends on both the density of air needed to fly and breath, and how cold-resistant the user is.</li>
<li>Because of the size of the wings needed, has to have enough room for both the lift-off and flight itself, not to mention enough speed to avoid stalling.
<ul><li>In addition, if the wings are large then it makes them vulnerable to intense/powerful sheering winds if they were to attempt a prolonged hover certain condition.</li></ul></li>
<li>May suffer from cold and/or altitude sickness unless the users have adapting skills to the changes in altitude.

<li>Wings can be damaged or destroyed, causing user to lose the ability to fly efficiently, stay airborne, or render them unable to fly.</li>
<li>Depending on the user, may expend energy if they need to flap the wings, either when taking off, flying, or landing.</li>
<li>Damage or destruction to wings may be injured similar to that of other limbs, leading to pain, bleeding, and infection.</li>
<li>May cause pain/harm to the user when wings develop from their back.</li>
<li>May require crystals/strength to keep it stable and furnish.</li></ul>
