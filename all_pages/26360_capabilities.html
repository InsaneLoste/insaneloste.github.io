<p>The user can utilize the Universal Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around universal power. Great forces exist in the universe (antimatter, dark matter, time, space, fundamental interactions, twilight, etc.). The user, through unique training and experience, is capable of tapping into the awesome might of these supernatural essences and/or wielding various abilities related to them. While it is conceivable to gain skills like enhanced physical power and heightened combat abilities, due to the nature of the forces involved, one could manifest techniques ranging from energy/matter manipulation to reality warping. Since universal forces are the constituents of existence, the feats that a user can accomplish may only be limited by oneâ€™s imagination or by the actual force(s) being wielded.
