<p>The user is able to apply incredible force to their feet, enabling them to deliver a supernatural kick. While this term has been used to describe many supernatural kicks, the true megaton kick is packed with <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent#Kiloton_and_megaton" title="wikipedia:TNT equivalent">4.18 petajoules of energy</a>. If delivered to the groin of an indestructible 200 lbs human, the massive kinetic energy dump would accelerate the target to over 6,000 km/s, exceeding <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity" title="wikipedia:Escape velocity">escape velocity</a> and launching them on a direction permanently away from earth.  Most targets, however, are not indestructible and they will give way or cease to exist before the full power of the kick is delivered. That megaton kick delivered to a typical 200 lbs human would result in complete obliteration of the body and still launch the shattered remains a considerable distance. The effect of a megaton kick is comparable to a directed nuclear explosion or a supernatural cannon. Users can kick through battle tank armor, smash down powerful fortress walls, and leave massive craters in the earth.
