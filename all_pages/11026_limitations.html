<li>Controlled gold is affected by everything that normal gold would be, although the user isÂ able to use their power to revert the gold into its original shape and/or controlling it even under these forces:
<ul><li>Melt under extreme heat (<a href="/wiki/Fire_Manipulation" title="Fire Manipulation">Fire Manipulation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Heat_Manipulation" title="Heat Manipulation">Heat Manipulation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Magma_Manipulation" title="Magma Manipulation">Magma Manipulation</a>).</li>
