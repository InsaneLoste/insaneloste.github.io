<p>The user's mere <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Presence" title="Presence">presence</a> in the area or proximity around them is the same as that of the <a href="/wiki/Solar_Embodiment" title="Solar Embodiment">sun</a> as they are producing <a href="/wiki/Solar_Generation" title="Solar Generation">solar energies</a> which effects and changes those surrounding areas just as a sun would. The area around user's inexplicable presence can cause positive and/or negative influences on the environment around them just as the sun would; causing <a href="/wiki/Plant_Growth" title="Plant Growth">plants to grow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Heat_Generation" title="Heat Generation">intense heat</a> and <a href="/wiki/Light_Generation" title="Light Generation">light</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Melting" title="Melting">melting</a> and could even <a href="/wiki/Burning" title="Burning">burn</a> their surroundings.
