<p>The user have a incorporeal form; itâ€™s a "body" that by nature lacks physical material or substance but can be made out of gas, energy, spirit, etc, all depending on the nature behind said form. Such a form can grant users a different kind of existence almost similar to that of a phantom free from the constraints of matter, allowing them to interact with both physical and none physical realties as a incorporeal being.
