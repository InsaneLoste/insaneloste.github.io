<p>The user is able to judge and decide which afterlife they will go to when they die, making it so that they go to either, heaven, hell, purgatory or not even go to an afterlife at all. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Afterlife_Marking" title="Afterlife Marking">Afterlife Marking</a>, the user does not need to imprint a mark of some kind onto others. They can just simply decide which afterlife a person will go to.
