<p>The user can teleport into and out of subspace (also known as <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hyperspace_(science_fiction)" title="wikipedia:Hyperspace (science fiction)">hyperspace</a>), an "alternate" space adjacent to the "normal" three-dimensional space and an integral part of the space-time continuum that coexists with normal space but is also distinct. This allows the user (and anything that they teleport) to travel much faster than the speed of light in normal space, as they move from one location to another instantaneously, while ignoring all physical obstacles in between.
