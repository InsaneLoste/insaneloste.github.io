<p>The user can negate/neutralise the increased effectiveness something has against something else; rendering some or all of their/its benefits, bonuses, etc, null. For example, a weapon which possesses an increased effectiveness against dragons, will against this ability not permanently lose that property, but rather the bonuses/effect of that effectiveness will be neutralised, making it to be normally effective against dragons. Another example would be, if a being of one type has a natural increased effectiveness against a being of another type, against this ability, the bonuses/effect of that effectiveness would be similarly made normal.
