<p>The user can take environments (ones they are in and associated with)/or inhabitants (whatever/whoever is in them) and shift them to another location, normally in place of or merging with the existing environment it teleports to. Everything in the environment may be teleported as well. The user can control the size of the taken area(s)/target(s), allowing teleportation of a large number of targets at once, or reducing to partial teleportation without the need to make physical contact with whatever they desire to teleport.
