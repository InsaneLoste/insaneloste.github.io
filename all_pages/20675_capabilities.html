<p>Users can manipulate numbers and quantities: how much there is of nearly anything they encounter. Adding makes objects larger (liquids and gases increase in quantity); Subtraction makes objects smaller (liquids and gases decrease in size); Multiplication increases how many of an object there are; Division causes the object to split into smaller portions.
