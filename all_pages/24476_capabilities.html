<p>The user can reduce the "total health" of their target, making it easier to kill them. One who could previously survive without most of their organs could be reduced to the point of being slain with a single tap after exposure to this power. By targeting the "total health" instead of/alongside inflicting damage, this acts as a vicious counter to even the strongest <a href="/wiki/Healing" title="Healing">healing</a> or <a href="/wiki/Regenerative_Healing_Factor" title="Regenerative Healing Factor">regeneration</a>, as these abilities cannot restore the "lost health" even after they've fixed any inflicted damage.
