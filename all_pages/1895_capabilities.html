<p>The user can turn objects and people into a work of art (actual beauty of the result may depend on the user). The transformed object/people may become distorted and lose all functionality, becoming ultimately useless for whatever purpose it functions for. The user may be bound by the style of art they can morph objects into such as abstract, pop, impressionism, romanticism and etc.
