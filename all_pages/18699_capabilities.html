<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate their own vortex. Usually, not always, surrounding their body is a swirling area of force, energy and/or matter that the user can manifest and control according to their will. They can control its radius (expanding/diminishing its size), its speed (accelerating/decelerating) and force factors (attraction/repulsion). Potentially, one can cause the vortex to expand into a larger, more powerful form.
