<p>User can ignore the fantasy/fiction/fantasy worlds, including their rules, physics, logic, and etc. Allowing them to do whatever they want by going based on their own rules instead of the fantasy worlds. User can substitute their own truth, logic, and/or context. Making them immune to the fantasy/fantasy world and letting them use their own logic in its place, even allowing them to do what is considered or should be impossible.
