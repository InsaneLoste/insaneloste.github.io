<p>The user can ignore their center of mass, "a distribution of mass in space is the unique point where the weighted relative position of the distributed mass sums to zero, or the point where if a force is applied it moves in the direction of the force without rotating". They gain great balance, can alter their own trajectory, can move even when they are unstable and can't fall over, or ignore toppling over due to being top heavy, side heavy, etc.  The user is able to keep level in motion and not bounce up and down when doing motions such as walking as well through making the position of their center of mass stable and not moving.
