<p>User can create beasts and other extraordinary creatures to serve the one who created the beast. They can be anything like a small companion to powerful beasts like dragons, monstrous beasts or demonic beasts. They can give birth to the beasts, generate them out of emotions (i.e. monsters made of fear, rage or envy) among other methods. These beasts can be an evolved, enhanced or modified version of pre-existent life forms, or a completely unique entity.
