<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Funayurei or are one, a Funayurei is a malevolent ghost that resides in the oceans and seeks to pursue and drown the living so as to add them into an ever-increasing spectral crew - they often gather in large groups, sailing ghost ships, they will wander the waves with large buckets and try to sink boats by filling them with sea water, once a boat is sunk they will drown the sailors and add them to their ranks.
