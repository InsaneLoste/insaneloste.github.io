<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a Transcendent Vampire: a supremely powerful vampiric being with  enough power to rival gods, or perhaps even being a vampiric god themselves. Transcendent Vampires are the supreme paragons of the species and are seen as the strongest of their race without equal. At times they are seen as the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Absolute_Prime_Source" title="Absolute Prime Source">source</a> of their race and the <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Prime_Being" title="Prime Being">first of their kind</a>, which leads to them being revered and worshiped by the entire vampire race. sometimes they either are or can ascend to the status of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Archetype:Patron_God" title="Archetype:Patron God">A God</a>. others may even rise to be the <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Vampire_Monarch" title="Archetype:Vampire Monarch"> absolute ruler</a> of all vampires.
