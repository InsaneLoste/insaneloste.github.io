<p>The user can utilize the Anti-Power Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around counteractive power. The user is capable of manifesting techniques based on abilities that can negate a particular target, whether it is an actual entity, a material or some type of supernatural force. The anti-power can be derived from outside sources or from within the user’s body. Whatever the origins, training allows one to wield specialized skills that can degrade, negate or otherwise remove some kind of power wielded by an opponent. While the main objective is supernatural negation, anti-power practice can potentially enhance the user’s physiology, alter their perceptions and even allow them to control the world around them.
