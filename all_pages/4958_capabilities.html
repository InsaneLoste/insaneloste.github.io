<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductivity" title="wikipedia:Conductivity">conductivity</a>, the ability of a material to conduct electricity, heat, fluid or sound. Different materials have different levels of resistance to various types of materials. Some materials, like metals, enable for little resistance to the flow of energy like heat and electricity, making them excellent conductors. Other materials, like wood, amorphous solids like glass and plastic and ceramics, provide a greater resistance to the transfer of energies. These are what's known as <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulator" title="wikipedia:Insulator">insulators</a>. There is also the fluid conductivity, usually associated with soil, porous rocks and vascular plants, which is the ability to easily transfer water. One with this ability can potentially alter the level of conductivity and resistance regarding materials and living beings. Enhancing or diminishing these properties can control the rate of transference or counteraction, allowing for safe passage of materials or preventing it, allowing for protection against harmful phenomena.
