<ul><li>This ability results from a personal logarithm with variables that have been left blank. Therefore, <i>solving</i> the user's personal logarithm may fill in the blank 'half-existence' of the user's form; however, it may also cause changes in appearance, personality and/or abilities (for the better or the worse)</li>
<li>If the user has no control over this ability, the following can happen:
<ul><li>Form may be permanent (until/unless one can solve the unsolved math problem one represents)
<ul><li>If solved, the user's power may be permanently deactivated</li></ul></li>
<li>May cause electronics and other energy systems, including others' minds and abilities, to flux randomly in one's presence (if one's power is sufficiently powerful)</li>
<li>Body stats (height, weight, shape, size, visibility, etc) may randomly fluctuate</li></ul></li>
<li>May randomly blink into (or out of) existence</li></ul>
