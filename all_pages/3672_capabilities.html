<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Camelid" title="wikipedia:Camelid">camelids</a>, including dromedaries, Bactrian camels, llamas, alpacas, vicu√±as, and guanacos. They can command, speak/understand, evolve/devolve, merge with, possess, etc., with all forms of camelids. Weaker users can only influence their behavior, commanding them to do their bidding.
