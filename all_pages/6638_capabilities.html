<p>The user can manipulate which direction something will go while keeping its original speed and power and which direction an object is facing, even if it isn't moving. Also with this power, the user is able to alter the concept of directions, making north south (and making it so that there is no north due to north and south being the same thing) and altering how directions work altogether, making things go in curves, loops or zigzags as they move rather than a straight line.
