<p>The user can slash through the dimension of time and destroy anything occupying that point in time, altering history by destroying certain objects, people, etc. Since the attack will strike at all temporal locations, this ensures a successful hit at a time when the target is vulnerable (i.e. before acquiring intangibility or immortality). By cutting open the time-space, user can either open up a portal to travel through time or control the speed of time depending on the cut's properties, such as severing the time's flow to stop it or slice a frozen time-stream to return it to normal.
