<p>User can create, shape and manipulate the <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wilderness" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">wilderness</a>, areas that are uninhabited (by humans), uncultivated, abandoned or inhospitable areas that are not altered by human activity. This does not necessarily include natural environments alone, as it can include cities and architecture that nature has reclaimed and are no longer inhabited by humans as well.
