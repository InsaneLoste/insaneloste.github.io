<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into an <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Umib%C5%8Dzu" title="wikipedia:Umibōzu">Umibōzu</a>. An umibōzu is a sea monster yokai that has multiple sightings throughout Japan. Normally, umibōzu appears to sailors on calm seas which quickly turn tumultuous. It either breaks the ship on emergence or demands a bucket or barrel from the sailors and proceeds to drown them. The only safe way to escape an umibōzu is to give it a bottomless barrel and sail away while it is confused.
