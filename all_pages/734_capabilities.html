<p>The user can avoid linear attacks such as <a href="/wiki/Bullet_Projection" title="Bullet Projection">bullets</a> and <a href="/wiki/Energy_Beam_Emission" title="Energy Beam Emission">lasers</a> by simply quickly positioning themselves away from the path of the attack before it is fired. This can allow the user to avoid attacks that travel much faster than the user themselves.
