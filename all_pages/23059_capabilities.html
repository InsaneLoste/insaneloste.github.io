<p>Users of this power transfer their souls within an object to make combat and survivability much easier due to the separation of body and soul. Despite the fact that the user's soul is separated from their body, they will still think and move like normal. With this power, the user's body is nothing more than a puppet that is controlled by their soul. Because of this, it is a wise idea for them to place their soul in a durable object or within a place that their enemies can't get to.
