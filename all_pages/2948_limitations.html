<li>Even though its created from the fabric of a black hole's quantum field, hawking radiation ironically destroys black holes due to the fact it reduces not only its mass, but also its size manually in order to evaporate them over time, and then possibly detonate as a supernova, at least depending on the size. The bigger black holes are less prone if not immune to that process, taking countless, if not an infinite amount of years for that to happen.</li>
<li>Users of <a href="/wiki/Space-Time_Manipulation" title="Space-Time Manipulation">Space-Time Manipulation</a> may be able to counter the distortion of the black hole, or even destroy it as opposed to creating them.</li>
