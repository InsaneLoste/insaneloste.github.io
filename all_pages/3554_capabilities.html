<p>Users of this ability can take on the traits of a Buggane (or are one), the Buggane is a malicious troll-like monster from Manx folklore that often travels the land causing havoc, sometimes purely out of their own will or as enforcers of retribution by fairies: Bugganes have fearsome powers that allow them to cause serious damage if they feel like it, often tearing the roofs off homes and one particularly powerful Buggane even engaged in a landscape-altering fight with an Irish Giant.
