<p>Users can manipulate, control, distort, and bend <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Space" title="wikipedia:Space">space</a>, the dimensions of height, depth, and width within which all things exist and move. Most commonly, users can use this ability to teleport by depleting the space from point A to point B, simply choosing to occupy a different space, creating portals, or by teleporting by creating a loophole made in space. At a higher level, users can 'pull' space together apart, effectively generating a magnetic pull which causes anything of the user's choosing to diverge upon or to rip apart any object by tearing away the space that it occupies. They can also do the opposite: 'pushing' space, which is essentially the expansion of space in a certain area to push away objects. Depending on how strong the 'push force', it can act as an unstoppable cannon that launches space and anything that occupied it.
