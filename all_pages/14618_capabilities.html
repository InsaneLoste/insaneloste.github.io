<p>Users possess great proficiency, capabilities and knowledge in <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Machine_gun" title="wikipedia:Machine gun">machine guns</a>, fully automatic, rifled autoloading firearms designed for sustained direct fire with rifle cartridges. As a class of military kinetic projectile weapon, machine guns are designed to be mainly used as infantry support weapons and generally used when attached to a bipod or tripod, a fixed mount or a heavy weapons platform for stability against recoils. Many machine guns also use belt feeding and open bolt operation, features not normally found on other infantry firearms.
