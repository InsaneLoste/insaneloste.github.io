<p>The user can create, shape, and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Force_field_(fiction)" title="wikipedia:Force field (fiction)">force-fields</a>, a field of energy without mass capable of <a href="/wiki/Energy_Matter_Manipulation" title="Energy Matter Manipulation">simulating</a> <a href="/wiki/Energy_Matter_Generation" title="Energy Matter Generation">matter</a> and act as a barrier or wall, so that objects affected by the particular force relating to the field are unable to pass through the field and reach the other side. The force-field durability is solely dependent on the user. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Force-Field_Generation" title="Force-Field Generation">Force-Field Generation</a>, this includes manipulating another personâ€™s force-field or force-field-related weapons at will, turning their defensive force-field against them, as well as <a href="/wiki/Force-Field_Constructs" title="Force-Field Constructs">shaping</a> force-fields into other objects.
