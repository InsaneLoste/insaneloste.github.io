<p>The user can create and project bolts of life-force and control the intensity/power of their projectiles, the bolts aren't weak, but they aren't as powerful as a <a href="/wiki/Life-Force_Blast" title="Life-Force Blast">full powered</a> attack. These bolts could be used to stun, burn, injure, or even penetrate/stab the enemy.
