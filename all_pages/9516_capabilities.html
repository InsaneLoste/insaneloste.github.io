<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a Family Deity, a god/goddess who represents or is associated with family, relatives, ancestors, descendants, and clans. Family Deities were common in mythology and are still present among the civilizations that worshiped their ancestors thus achieving a god-like status. Even regular deities themselves could connect to their deceased human family members that they began on earth.
