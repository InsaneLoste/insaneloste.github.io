Plants undergo various types of organic operations during their daily lives: germination, hydration, photosynthesis. During these operations, they are capable of creating various types of chemical substances. They can range from nutrient-related materials (e.g., nectar, sap) to poisons (e.g., alkaloids). Studies in this chemistry field have been done to create new types of pest repellents and pharmaceuticals.
