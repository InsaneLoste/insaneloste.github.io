An underworld where the dead live in shadow was common to beliefs in ancient West Asia. In Biblical Hebrew, it was called <i>tsalmaveth</i> (צַלמָוֶת: lit. "death-shadow", "shadow of death") as an alternate term for Sheol. The Witch of Endor in the First Book of Samuel notably conjures the ghost (<i>owb</i>) of Samuel.
