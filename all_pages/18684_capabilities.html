<p>The user can control their own thermochemistry. They are able to manipulate self-generated thermochemical reactions and their properties. This includes exothermic, endothermic reactions, manipulating heat, and the activation energy required to start said reactions. By extending their reactive energies outward, they can thermochemically manipulate energy and matter as well.
