<p>The user can 'split' the world into alternate timelines. This ability allows the user to try out and test any possible outcomes or choices as well as being able to attempt any course of action that they desire in an alternate timeline, with the user being able to just simply pick and keep the timeline where their choices/actions had the desired results. This selected timeline then becomes the new reality, with the other alternate timelines where the user did not achieve what they wanted being collapsed, the user being the only one that remembers the collapsed timelines. The user can use this ability for a variety of purposes, with examples such as, but not limited to, planning events, running through time and future possibilities to see if they succeed, gaining information that would otherwise not be possible to gain, seeing how the future plays out in response to different choices/actions that you could make, and having more than one chance in trying to achieve something.
