<p>The user's power decays in effectiveness over time, whether losing techniques or losing power behind those techniques. Either through further use of the ability or other mechanics behind the power set itself, the ability is, at best, not seeming to decay at any given moment, but the devolution does not reverse, only increasing or decreasing in speed.
