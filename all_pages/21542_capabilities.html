<p>The user can ignore their rotational mass, the resistance to changes in angular velocity, allowing one to ignore their inertia and the squared distance factor that is part of rotational mass and do rotational feats not normally possible. The user can also defy their own rotational mass if they are hollow, in which hollow things normally move slower than solid objects.
