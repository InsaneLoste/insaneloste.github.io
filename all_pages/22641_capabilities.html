<p>The user possesses and is able to use slayer power, any power or force capable of (or revolving around) counteracting or killing certain individuals or types of creatures. These powers manifest as repelling such individuals, negating their powers, or even killing them outright. This ability not only grants the user great strength, abilities, and control over numerous variations of slayer-derived energies, but also allows them to overwhelm weaker slayers as well as rival that of powerful slayer entities.
