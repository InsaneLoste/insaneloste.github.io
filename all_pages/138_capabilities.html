<p>The user can elevate the thermodynamic temperature of their surroundings to absolute hot, which has been theorized to be the Planck Temperature (1.416 × 10<sup>32</sup> K, or 142,000 billion billion billion kelvin/142 nonillion kelvin). Physics based on Einstein’s universal model start to come apart at the seams when that temperature is reached. At temperatures that high, particle energies increase to a point where their gravitational forces are as substantial as any other kinds of fundamental forces. Gravity, electromagnetism, strong nuclear forces and weak nuclear forces combine into a single, unified force.
