<p>User can combine elemental powers, granting one element the properties and functions of another. For example, the user is able to grant <a href="/wiki/Darkness_Manipulation" title="Darkness Manipulation">darkness</a> the piercing abilities of <a href="/wiki/Light_Manipulation" title="Light Manipulation">light</a>. This in turn will grant the user the possibility to stand against, or possibly overwhelm, most singular elements. However, unlike <a href="/wiki/Elemental_Recomposition" title="Elemental Recomposition">Elemental Recomposition</a>, the user is unable to form new elements.
