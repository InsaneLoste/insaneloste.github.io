With the cohesion between the molecules remaining sufficient to hold them together, one could alter the most rigid of substances into a soft and flexible form like taffy, or evenÂ make a flimsy material change into tempered and/or brittle elements such as stained glass; i.e. causing something hard to have rubber like flexibility, apply the reverse, and more.
