<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate dimensional borders, or borders/barriers that separate different universes/dimensions and move between universes/dimensions. They can merge/divide universes/dimensions or parts of universes/dimensions, or crossover elements from different dimensions by removing dimensional borders. They can shrink or enlarge dimensions and universes, and manipulate the barriers so they become impassable or only passable to some.
