<p>The user can manipulate their own personal astronomical object(s). Celestial bodies (moons, stars, space rocks, etc.) are usually capable of influencing and/or being accessed by a multitude of individuals, such as absorbing their energies to grow stronger. Normally, they are too big to be contained and/or controlled. With this power, however, individuals are connected to specific cosmic structures. Whether it is of actual astronomic size or exists in a miniaturized form, having access to it allows for supernatural capabilities unique to the user.
