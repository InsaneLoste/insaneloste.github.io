<p>Hive mind allows a group of people (often biologically related) "share" the same mind. In some cases, one person could take control of another separate body to add to the hive. Like most hive insects like bees and ants, each can work autonomously, though they think the same thing at the same time. The members have little individuality, more or less they are only marionettes controlled by a puppeteer.
