<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrochemistry" title="wikipedia:Electrochemistry">electrochemistry</a>, the scientific field that deals with the interrelated aspects of electricity and chemical processes. There are several phenomena associated with this discipline. One is <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electrolysis" title="wikipedia:Electrolysis">electrolysis</a>, where an electric current is applied to certain substances in order to trigger a chemical reaction. Another example is a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Redox" title="wikipedia:Redox">redox</a> reaction, where there is a change in the oxidation states of certain elements due to electron transfers. This can result in electricity generation. This also occurs in the human body, where an interplay between the negatively charged aspects of cells and positively charged aspects of surrounding tissue triggers electrical impulses that control action and thoughts.
