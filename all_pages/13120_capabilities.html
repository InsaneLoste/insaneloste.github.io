<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strong_interaction" title="wikipedia:strong interaction">strong force</a>: one of the four fundamental forces in the physical universe, accountable for numerous phenomenon instances, especially those related to the binding of protons and neutrons in atomic nuclei. The strong force is amenable for <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/strong_interaction" title="wikipedia:strong interaction">strong nuclear force</a> (a force that overcomes the electric repulsion between protons and binds them together), the formation of atomic nuclei, and the stability of matter itself. Investigation of the strong interaction requires comprehension of assorted domains of physical science, including nuclear physics, particle physics, and quantum chromodynamics. The strong interaction is one of the fundamental forces behind nuclear interactions. The strong force exhibits incredible properties, and its manipulation enables users to harness the energy that powers stars, nuclear reactors, and other high-energy processes.
