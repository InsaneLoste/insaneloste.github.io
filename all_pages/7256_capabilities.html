<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dullahan" title="wikipedia:Dullahan">dullahan</a>, a headless humanoid faerie, usually seen riding a black horse and carrying their head. The head's eyes are massive and constantly dart about like flies, while the mouth is constantly in a hideous grin that touches both sides of the head. The flesh of the head is said to have the color and consistency of moldy cheese.
