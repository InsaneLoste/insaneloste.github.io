Matter is one of the most common substances that describes the universe, including its variations and oppositions. From <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orders_of_magnitude" title="wikipedia:Orders of magnitude">the orders of magnitude</a>, matter can range from subatomic particles to astronomical scales, such as the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Observable_universe" title="wikipedia:Observable universe">observable universe</a>. More specifically, elementary particles, atoms, molecules, cells, microorganisms, everyday objects, animals, buildings, cities, mountains, continents, planets, planetary systems, and galaxies are composed or contain fragments of matter that define it. Matter can exist in different states, generally through solid, liquid, gas, plasma, and other matter states. Because the user can control matter, the user can manipulate nearly "anything" in the universe.
