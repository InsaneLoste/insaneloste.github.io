A segben is an extremely powerful and dangerous werewolf-like monster found in Philippine mythology that is not only a fearsome predator with a taste for humans, but has the ability to instantly kill anything it touches with its tongue; even a single lick will cause its victim to die and allow the beast to feast on their lifeless bodies.
