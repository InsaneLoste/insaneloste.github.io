<p>The users can create, change and destroy <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axiom" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">axioms</a> - the fundamental, self-evident truths that define the most basic logic of existence, from which all other logic, rules and structure can be derived. As such, by creating, changing and destroying axioms, the user can essentially redefine the <a href="/wiki/Logic_Manipulation" title="Logic Manipulation">rules of logic</a> from the ground up. This allows the user to fundamentally <a href="/wiki/Reality_Warping" title="Reality Warping">alter reality</a> by changing the axioms that make up the foundation of its logic, as well as <a href="/wiki/Universe_Creation" title="Universe Creation">create</a> and <a href="/wiki/Universe_Destruction" title="Universe Destruction">destroy</a> entire universes by creating and destroying their axioms, and so much more.
