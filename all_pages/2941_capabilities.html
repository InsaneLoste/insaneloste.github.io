Although the Church Grim is not a Barghest or Shuck, it can also take the form of a large black dog, a being found primarily in the folklores of the British Isles. The black dog is essentially a nocturnal apparition, often associated with the Devil or a Hellhound. It is generally supposed to be larger than a normal dog, and often has large, glowing eyes, often associated with electrical storms, crossroads, places of execution and ancient pathways.
