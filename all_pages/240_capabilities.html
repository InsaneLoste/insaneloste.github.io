<p>Users can reduce the thermodynamic temperature of their surroundings to <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero" title="wikipedia:Absolute zero">absolute zero</a> (-459.67°F or -273.15°C) at will. Heat is generated via atomic motions, and even at extremely low temperatures, they continue to transfer energy; only when atoms completely stop moving is "absolute zero" achieved. While lowering the temperature by slowing molecular and atomic motion is the basics of freezing, to completely stop it is to completely bypass the Laws of Thermodynamics.
