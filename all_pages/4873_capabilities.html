<p>User can manipulate the abstracts (or concept) of lightning. This can have many feats, including electricity that can turn insulators into conductors, produce electricity that drains energy rather then charging/recharging it, conduct through materials that are normally unresponsive to electricity, make electricity unresponsive to water, harm things that can <a href="/wiki/Electricity_Absorption" title="Electricity Absorption">absorb</a> or are <a href="/wiki/Electrical_Immunity" title="Electrical Immunity">immune</a> to electricity and much more.
