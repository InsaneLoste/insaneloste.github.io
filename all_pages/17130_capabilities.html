<p>The user either is or can mimic/transform into a Nure-Onna, a vampiric sea serpent. The Nure-Onna's haunting grounds are typically rivers and shores. There they seek out humans to eat. They possess the head/face of a woman and the body of a sea serpent. Depending on the version, the Nure-Onna may or may not possess arms. This serpent relies on trickery despite being stronger than a human. There are tales of the Nure-Onna disguising themselves as distraught woman carrying a bundled baby crying for help. This is to lure anyone passing by such as fisherman or sailors. The Nure-Onna will beg them to take the baby. If they agree and take the baby, the baby will increase in weight and immobilize the victim allowing for the Nure-Onna to such their blood from their tongue.
