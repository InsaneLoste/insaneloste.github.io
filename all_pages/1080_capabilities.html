<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Amazake Baba or are one, a Amazake Baba is a type of yokai-hag from Japanse folklore that resembles ugly old women who travel from door to door begging for amazake (a type of sake), anyone who answers her calls for these things will be struck with illness and misfortune, in ancient times the disease was believed to be smallpox but over time the hags have since been altered and instead they spread the much less lethal common cold but are still spirits that are deeply unwelcome, thankfully there are several methods by which to ensure the hags will not come to one's door and thus be spared of their influence.
