<p>The user has a fixed, constant duration/time when moving, meaning that the time they take to move any distance is always fixed, especially in a short duration/in short times, which maybe finite or indefinite. The user can change the distance they travel in, but the duration says the same in all situations. Even gravity may not change the duration. When moving, the duration is usually the "seconds" in "meters per second" in speed or velocity.
