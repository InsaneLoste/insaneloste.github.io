<p>Users are tangible representations or manifestations of an idea, abstraction, or another tangible thing. They are usually humanoid in appearance but with particular physical characteristics that take after the concept they embody along with personality traits and behavior associated with said concept. More importantly, most embodiments have some form of affinity with their concept, either with their bodies being made out of it or being empowered by it when the concept is present. They would also possess some form of control over their concept depending on the affinity between the personification and the concept itself.
