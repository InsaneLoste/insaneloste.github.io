<li>May be connected to emotions.</li>
<li>May be limited on how many times in a certain period it can be used.</li>
<li>May require exact measurements of probability.</li>
<li>Other users of probability manipulation may be immune to probability manipulation or can simply reverse the effects.</li>
<li>May be limited to causing or preventing likely/unlikely things happening.</li>
<li>Limited to things that are possible i.e. the possibility of a given event must be above 0% to cause it and less than 100% to prevent it (in certain cases, the probability of a given event might also need to be above 0% to cause it and less than 100% to prevent it) and/or to manipulate a given event; can't make the impossible happen and can't prevent the absolute from happening (e.g. cannot make a world in which a given thing exists and does not exists in the same sense at the same time); can at most make the highly unlikely happen and/or prevent the highly likely from happening. In other words, this power is limited by causality, logic, reality, and truth.</li>
<li>Effort/strength required may be inversely proportional to the likelihood of the event happening (harder to make rarer things happen).</li>
<li>May be capable affecting the past only if it is unknown (e.g., winning the lottery after having purchased a ticket only if no one knew what numbers were on the ticket, or opening a box and finding it full of gold coins only if no one knew what was supposed to be inside the box nor how much it weighed).

<li>If the probability is actually measured for [blank], then it might cause other equally likely/unlikely things to happen.</li>
