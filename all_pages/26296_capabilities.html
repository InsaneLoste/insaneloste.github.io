<p>The user exists in an undefined/undetermined state, meaning that they don't fit into the standard mold or categories/classifications of existing beings. As such they cannot be truly considered to be living or dead and amortal or undead, instead they exist in an undefined grey area both inside and outside of the standard categories of existing creatures.
