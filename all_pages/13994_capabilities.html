<p>The life aspects are the different perspectives for life and the result of experiences. The user embodies the concept of life and gains power when they are fighting for these aspects, for example, they do not necessarily induce the determination aspect but only represents it and gains power based on the trait. These aspects are a reflection of all rational beings by their beliefs, reasons for existence, appearances and actions. There are diverse attributes people live by, e.g. by bonds, balance, determination, youthfulness, etc. and this power is used to embrace that aspect to its maximum potential.
