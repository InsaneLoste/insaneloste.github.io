<p>User can cause weather conditions/patterns to randomly and spontaneously change, allowing them to generate unusual or unnatural weather conditions in areas that shouldn't be able to or is impossible to have them (such as snow in the desert, drought in the rainforest, lightning storms in areas that don't or never receive cloud cover, etc.). Any weather effect can be reached, only that it will always be random.
