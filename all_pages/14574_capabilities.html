<p>The user can gain powers through a symbiotic relationship with a lunar being/moon. The host usually absorbs the energy of the moon or <a href="/wiki/Lunar_Embodiment" title="Lunar Embodiment">lunar embodiment</a> and uses it to enhance their abilities and/or wield supernatural powers. While it may be impossible to play vessel to an actual moon, one can house its essence for the user’s benefit, allowing for energy, elemental and matter manipulation powers based on the moon’s nature. Because of the symbiotic relationship between host and moon, both can benefit/suffer from each other’s state of being.
