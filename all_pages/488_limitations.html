<li>Many users manipulate energy into their preferred or primary form of energy. This may not always be through conscious choice and thus can be out of the user's control.</li>
<li>User may change the energy that makes up users that have an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_Physiology" title="Energy Physiology">Energy Physiology</a>.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Energy_Immunity" title="Energy Immunity">Energy Immunity</a> is immune to any kind of energy that the user can wield, and thus is the bane of any user of this ability.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Energy_Negation" title="Energy Negation">Energy Negation</a> can negate the energy made/controlled by the user. This is true for advanced users of <a href="/wiki/Energy_Erasure" title="Energy Erasure">Energy Erasure</a> and <a href="/wiki/Anti-Energy_Manipulation" title="Anti-Energy Manipulation">Anti-Energy Manipulation</a>.</li>
<li>Manipulation of large amounts of energy can cause a user to become very exhausted. Along with this, high amounts of concentration be necessary in order to convert certain types of energy (e.g. Gamma rays to Infrared).</li>
<li>May be limited to what kind of energy they can change (E.g. A user may only be able to change different types of energy into Electricity).</li>
<li>May become addicted to the exhilaration of changing energies.</li>
<li>May not be able to control the energy that they change, or manipulate energy at all.</li>
<li>May not be immune to their own powers, or may harbor weaknesses to select forms of energy.</li>
<li>May only be able to change a certain type of energy.</li></ul>
