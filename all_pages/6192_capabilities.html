<p>The user has the "<a href="/wiki/Demonic_Force_Manipulation" title="Demonic Force Manipulation">Demonic</a>" form of <a href="/wiki/Divinity" title="Divinity">Divinity</a>,  and divine powers granting them an immense amount of raw power beyond the mundane, making the users divine demonic beings by nature and a dark divine being, a status which can be obtained by several different ways. Users can gain this type of divinity by having an <a href="/wiki/Dark_Divinity" title="Dark Divinity">dark divine</a> ancestry (being born a demon-deity), being transformed into an <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Divine-Demonic_Physiology" title="Divine-Demonic Physiology">divine demon</a> either by another more powerful divine demon, a deity, higher being such as a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transcendent_Demon_Physiology" title="Transcendent Demon Physiology">transcendent demon</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ascended_Transcendent_Demon_Physiology" title="Ascended Transcendent Demon Physiology">ascended transcendent demon</a>,  etc, users have dominion and godhood in the divine and demonic aspects which makes them formidable in both worlds capable of overcoming all manner of demonic entities by sheer will alone.
