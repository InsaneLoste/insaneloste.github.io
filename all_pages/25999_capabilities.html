The Tuatha Dé Danann were portrayed as an opposite of the Fomorians, otherwise known as the Fomhóraigh, who were dark gods and opponents of the Tuatha Dé, with the Fomorians being gods who represented the destructive powers of nature, whereas the Tuatha Dé were representative of the helpful powers of nature.
