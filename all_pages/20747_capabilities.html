<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quest" title="wikipedia:Quest">quests</a>, a long journey towards a specific goal. Quests are considered the most difficult forms of challenges and the user can manipulate anything about them. Allowing them to decide the difficulty (including making the quest nigh impossible if they feel it's too easy), the obstacles, the rewards, they can even decide how it begins and how it ends as well.
