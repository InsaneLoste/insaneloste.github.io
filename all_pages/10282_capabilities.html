<p>The user can utilize the Formula Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around formulaic power. Formulae (symbolic information expressions) are responsible for creating logically constructed representations of the world. They give observers and creators a way to methodically demonstrate the inherent nature of and design behind aspects of reality (energy, matter, shape, space, etc.). Normally, they are associated with sciences like chemistry and mathematics. In supernatural circumstances, one can utilize formulae to gain some sense of control over reality, not simply explain it. It is a way of wielding a unique form of logic to bring about uncanny effects.
