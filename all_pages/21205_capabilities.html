<p>The user's overall momentum of their whole body is unaffected by the momentum of their body parts. So, if the user is moving at one speed and one direction, and they move their body parts in another speed and direction, no matter how fast or heavy they are, the user does not have their overall, whole body momentum change, and they keep going at the velocity they are going at and not lose balance.
