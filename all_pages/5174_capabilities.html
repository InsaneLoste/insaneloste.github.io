<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate energy that enables corruption. This unique energy allows the user to defile targets, whether living or inanimate, darken the hearts of others (possibly unlocking deeply hidden evil impulses) and otherwise bring about corrupted effects in others. Certain beings possess a malignant force that corrodes, degenerates and ultimately reviles individuals touched by it. Successive afflictions as well as corruptions of the affected can increase the power of its spread/infection. Users and those they enthrall become more powerful and more malignant with each successively fiendish act committed.
