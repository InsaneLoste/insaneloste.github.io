<p>The user can feel the texture of objects they have a telekinetic hold on when other objects/subjects come into contact with them and probe them at a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Molecular_manipulation" title="Molecular manipulation">molecular</a> level to identify if they contain alien materials or feel when two things which they have a telekinetic hold upon are similarly composed. Alternatively, the user can achieve this by enhancing their sense of touch through psionic energy/focus, which in turn can allow for the perception of texture at a distance and without physical contact, as well as increasing the acuity of their natural sense of touch using telekinesis.
