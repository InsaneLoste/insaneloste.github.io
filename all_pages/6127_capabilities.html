<p>The user can "split", much like a cell, into physical organic clones indefinitely depending on available resources. This power often generally causes all clones to lack an autonomous intelligence, instead being a unit in a collective "hivemind", each clone being just one "cell" of a unified consciousness (usually that of the subject).
This power benefits because if the "original" subject dies, a clone can take their place as the central point of the hivemind making the subject technically immortal as long as there are sufficient copies to take their place.
