<p>The user can manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_interaction" title="wikipedia:Weak interaction">weak force</a>, one of the four fundamental forces of nature that underlies some forms of radioactivity, governs the decay of unstable subatomic particles such as mesons, and initiates the nuclear fusion reaction that fuels the Sun. As such, the Weak Force is believed to be why the Sun can provide the Earth with energy. Through this power, a user will generate and control different types of radiation.
