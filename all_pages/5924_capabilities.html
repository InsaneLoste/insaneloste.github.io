<p>Users are able to function normally without the use of their heart, so said organ is considered "dead" or "non-functioning". Literally, this means the heart is still inside the user's body but simply doesn't work. Conceptually, it means the user has suffered a severe trauma that has caused the "death" of their heart, making them unable to experience positive feelings and emotions and in the worst cases, all emotions. This causes a sudden change in their personality, making them cold, "heartless" and devoid of compassion.
