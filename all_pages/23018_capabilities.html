<p>The user's body is comprised of, or can be entirely transformed into living sound. A user's transformed state may stay anatomically identical to their normal human form, aside from being made of sound, in which case it contains all the usual vital organs, and is somewhat vulnerable to attack. Alternately, the user can transform into a fully homogeneous sound state, with no individual aspect of their anatomy being more important than the other.
