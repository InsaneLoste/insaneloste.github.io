<p>The user can utilize the Bloodline Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around hereditary power. There are instances of individuals who possess unique supernatural abilities rooted in their DNA. By virtue of some familial essence inherited from oneâ€™s ancestors or some aberrant genetic mutation, one is capable of harnessing supernatural abilities completely unavailable to anyone outside of a particular bloodline. Even if there are others who are of the same species, unless they share the same unique ancestry, they cannot possess this signature power. Through practice and training, one is capable of exhibiting distinctive techniques based on their genetic abilities, including martial skills (<a href="/wiki/Attack_Powers" title="Attack Powers">attack powers</a>), physical enhancements (heightened senses, speed, strength, etc.), supporting practices (<a href="/wiki/Healing" title="Healing">healing</a>) and/or skills affecting the nature of existence (universal force control, <a href="/wiki/Reality_Warping" title="Reality Warping">reality warping</a>, etc.).
