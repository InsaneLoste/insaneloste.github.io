<p>The user can control the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mind" title="wikipedia:Mind">minds</a> of others, including their <a href="/wiki/Thought_Manipulation" title="Thought Manipulation">thoughts</a>, <a href="/wiki/Sense_Manipulation" title="Sense Manipulation">perceptions</a>, <a href="/wiki/Behavior_Manipulation" title="Behavior Manipulation">behaviours</a>, <a href="/wiki/Motor-Skill_Manipulation" title="Motor-Skill Manipulation">movements</a>, <a href="/wiki/Memory_Manipulation" title="Memory Manipulation">memories</a>, <a href="/wiki/Emotion_Manipulation" title="Emotion Manipulation">emotions</a> and <a href="/wiki/Personality_Manipulation" title="Personality Manipulation">personality</a>. Depending on the user's skill and power, this can range from a trance-like state very similar to hypnosis, to the target being completely subject to the user's control. A skilled user may be able to control the minds of multiple people simultaneously. The target(s) can be placed in a semi-conscious state, where they may have no recollection of any actions that they perform while under the user's control; and whilst enthralled, the recipients may display capacities that they would otherwise not be capable of in their normal state.
