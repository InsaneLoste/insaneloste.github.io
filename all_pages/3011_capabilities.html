<p>User can increase their own physical and spiritual prowess via a positive supernatural benediction they have; this power usually activates when the user exhibits strong positive emotion or distress. As the user masters the power, the positive effects of the mystical benefit become less apparent as the victim's body becomes more accustomed to the blessing. When the blessing or benefit is removed from the user, their powers will disappear until the blessing is re-initiated.
