<p>User can manipulate the boundary between the objective and the subjective, as in facts and opinions, tastes and feelings. They can make it so one's opinion becomes fact, such as a TV show being good or bad, or what they think should be the reality of things, and thus replacing current fact with one's very own opinion.
