<p>The user possesses defenses or defensive powers that can adapt to offensive abilities, either by simply continually raising the user's durability to out scale the threat or developing resistances or even immunities to abilities used against them. The most extreme examples can even generate new abilities specifically for the purpose of defending the user. With each use the user's defensive capabilities will scale. This could eventually result in invulnerability, dependent on the capabilities of the user.
