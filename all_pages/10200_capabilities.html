These different types of energy can either be the traditional types of energy or something completely unorthodox. Some users can create new types of energy, either from scratch or as a working foundation of preexisting elements. Thanks to the nature of the unique type of elements and their special properties, the user is capable of causing various types of effects, whether they are beneficial, detrimental or neutral. Depending on the variant forces they are made from, the elements the user controls can offer unique abilities and other attributes beyond that of normal elements.
