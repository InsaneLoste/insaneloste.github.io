<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nachzehrer" title="wikipedia:Nachzehrer">nachzehrer</a>, a species of vampires. Most of the time they are created most commonly after suicide, and sometimes from an accidental death. According to German lore, a person does not become a nachzehrer from being bitten or scratched; the transformation happens after death and is not communicable. Nachzehrers are also related to sickness and disease. If a large group of people died of the plague, the first person to have died is believed to be a nachzehrer.
