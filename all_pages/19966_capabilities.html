<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate earth of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Earth Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiment of earth. As such, they can cause natural earth effects such as mudslides, earthquakes, and sinkholes to manifest. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Earth Manipulation as earth is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunities to earth based powers.
