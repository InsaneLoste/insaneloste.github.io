<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Potential_energy" title="wikipedia:Potential energy">potential energy</a>, i.e., the energy of an object relating to its state of being or position. The energy is stored in the object and remains there, so long as the object remains unaltered or stationary. Potential refers to the possibility of the energy's use in the future in some capacity. Potential energy is connected to forces. When a force acts on an object with potential energy, it is transformed into a new type of energy (electricity, heat, light, sound, kinetic energy, etc.).
