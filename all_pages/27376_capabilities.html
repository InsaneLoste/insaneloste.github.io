<p>A user of this power either is or can transform into a Werepire, a <a href="/wiki/Hybrid_Physiology" title="Hybrid Physiology">hybrid</a> of a <a href="/wiki/Vampire_Physiology" title="Vampire Physiology">vampire</a> and any type of <a href="/wiki/Werebeast_Physiology" title="Werebeast Physiology">werebeast</a> which is capable of using all the powers of both parent species and (in most cases) using them to enhance each other. These hybrids often have an immunity to several weaknesses that their parent species have, such as: silver, gold, sunlight, but something that affects both parent species may still affect them (decapitation).
