<p>The user's kiss carries parasites or insects that travel from the user's mouth and body into the victim. This can cause the victim to become a host of a parasite or insects that may feed on the victim or kill them quickly. It can possibly be used as a means to infect others with parasites for the purposes of controlling or puppeteering them. This power is often always active or may be out of the user's control.
