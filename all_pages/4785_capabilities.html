<p>The user can move through areas they are not supposed to or areas that have things they are weak to or are negatively affected by. Therefore, the user does not extinguish in water while on fire, does not melt in heat while frozen or made of ice, does not freeze in the cold as a being of water, does not lose their kinetic energy in motion dampening fields, and so on. The user might even combine two forms despite them being incompatible with each other, like fire and water. The user can also move through things that decrease the user's powers or movements.
