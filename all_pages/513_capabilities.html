The Adaro is a malevolent merman-like sea spirit found in the mythology of the Solomon Islands said to arise from the wicked part of a person's spirit, which is divided between the Aunga (good) which dies, and the Adaro (evil) which stays as a <a href="/wiki/Topielec_Physiology" title="Topielec Physiology">ghost</a>. They are very dangerous and are described as a person with gills behind their ears, tail fins instead of feet, a shark dorsal fin-like horn and a spear growing out of its head, like a swordfish or sawfish. They also travel in waterspouts trailing the paths where rainbows form to find and reach new victims to kill by firing flying fish at them or up contact.
