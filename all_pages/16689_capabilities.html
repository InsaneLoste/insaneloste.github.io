<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nebula" title="wikipedia:Nebula">nebula</a>; an interstellar cloud of dust, hydrogen, helium, and other ionized gases, with some being formed from a supernova. Most nebulae are of vast size, even hundreds of light years in diameter. Although denser than the space surrounding them, most nebulae are far less dense than any vacuum created in an Earthen environment - a nebular cloud the size of the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Earth" title="wikipedia:Earth">Earth</a> would have a total mass of only a few kilograms.
