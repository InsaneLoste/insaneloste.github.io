<p>User can make any and all of their attacks hit/strike an opponent weaknesses, this allows user to automatically weaken the target with any attack they want. Alternatively, some user can harm an opponent based on the target's weaknesses, such as a target has a weakness against fire for the user to attack them, automatically inflicting fire-based damage, regardless of the attack performed, even if the user doesn't have any fire-based attacks.
