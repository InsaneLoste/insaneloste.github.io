<p>The user can generate and/or project <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Holography" title="wikipedia:Holography">holograms</a>, fully three-dimensional images generally <a href="/wiki/Photokinetic_Constructs" title="Photokinetic Constructs">composed</a> of <a href="/wiki/Light_Generation" title="Light Generation">light</a> or some other kind of <a href="/wiki/Energy_Generation" title="Energy Generation">energy</a> that is externally <a href="/wiki/Energy_Constructs" title="Energy Constructs">manipulated</a> into specific <a href="/wiki/Shape_Generation" title="Shape Generation">shapes</a>, often through the use of <a href="/wiki/Force-Field_Constructs" title="Force-Field Constructs">concentrated</a> <a href="/wiki/Force-Field_Generation" title="Force-Field Generation">energy fields</a>. As such, they normally are based on sight and potentially also <a href="/wiki/Sound_Sculpting" title="Sound Sculpting">sound</a>, but normally have no effect to other senses or any true physical presence, meaning that most holograms can only sensorially interact with their environment.
