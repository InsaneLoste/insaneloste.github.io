<p>Users can covert worlds into any kind of chthonian world; completely turning worlds into damaged, noxious versions of themselves which capitalizes a unique/common form of dystopia. Anything or everything in their world can be unmade or impaired to the point of an indefinite stagnation, if not, outright self-destructive, apocalyptic transfiguration of inferno, leaving inhabitants either degraded, confounded or prone to self-destructive wickedness. Planets are terraformed into the most hideous and/or blighted of terrains with cruelty, unfairness and blame fueled-injustices being its marred and impaired norm.
