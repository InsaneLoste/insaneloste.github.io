<p>User can totally convert absolutely anything/everything into a usable state and the reverse, such as converting any fuel completely into energy, including any/all by-products and leftover or waste material.

They will be able to completely break it down and convert all of it into a usable form, leaving absolutely nothing of what the substance or product originally was or even its reverse by converting energy into matter with no spill-off of energy or explosions.
