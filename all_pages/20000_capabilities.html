<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate lunar forces of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Lunar Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiments of moons themselves. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Lunar Manipulation as the moon is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunity to lunar based abilities.
