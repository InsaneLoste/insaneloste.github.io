<p>The user, either innate or through training has mastered the martial arts style of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arnis" title="wikipedia:Arnis">Arnis/Erikama</a> which incorporates weapon-based fighting with sticks, <a href="/wiki/Knife_Proficiency" title="Knife Proficiency">knives</a>, bladed weapons, and various <a href="/wiki/Improvised_Weapon_Proficiency" title="Improvised Weapon Proficiency">improvised weapons</a>, as well as "open hand" techniques without weapons. Through instructions, students learn to fight with weapons, then advance empty-hand training once stick and knife-fighting has been mastered, acquiring muscle memory and becoming ambidextrous, treating weapons as an extension of themselves. Often in battle, in handling the weapon in one hand, the other one would be free to attack their opponent form another angle. Even if one weapon is used, then the other hand can be used to control, trap, or disarm opponents, in addition to <a href="/wiki/Blocking_Mastery" title="Blocking Mastery">blocking</a>, <a href="/wiki/Joint_Manipulation" title="Joint Manipulation">joint locking</a>, and manipulation. An obvious fact in this is that armed opponents who has been trained has the advantage over a trained unarmed person, and serves to condition students to fight against armed assailants.
