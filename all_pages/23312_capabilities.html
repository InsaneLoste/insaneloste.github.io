<p>The user can take a said section of space and create a copy of it, and then recreate that said space within somewhere else. This in effect allows them to record and duplicate enemy attacks and use it as their own. In such a case, it may appear the user is manipulating time to recreate such effects, though it is simply to recreate the space (and everything occurring within) in another area; in short, a "copy-and-paste" effect.
