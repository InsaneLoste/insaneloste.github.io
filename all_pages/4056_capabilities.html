<p>The user can remove the specific traits of others and place the victim in a state where they are devoid of the characteristic that they once had. For example, if the user used their ability on someone who prided their physical strength, then their strength would be taken from them to render the victim frail. Another example would be if the victims valued their beauty or toughness in which they would be rendered hideous or vulnerably weak by the user's power.
