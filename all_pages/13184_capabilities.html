<p>User can intuitively understand what is going to happen and how to deal with it. This power works on a purely instinctual level: users don't <a href="/wiki/Precognition" title="Precognition">receive any additional data</a>, but can spontaneously feel how events are going to unfold and what the best course of action is, making it more of an inherent part of themselves than an external ability. Thus they always automatically make the most optimal decision in any scenario. Allowing them to achieve the best possible results in all fields of life and deal with events in the most efficient manner. They automatically seize all opportunities and make the most out of any situation.
