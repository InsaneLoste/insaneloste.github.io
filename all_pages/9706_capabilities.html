<p>Users of this ability can take on the traits of a fenodyree (or are one), a benevolent type of brownie from Manx folklore that resembles a small, extremely hairy humanoid that will aid mortals during the hours of night via performing many varied tasks in exchange for food and milk. However, they become offended if offerings of clothing are presented to them and will abandon their former patrons if such a taboo offering is presented to them.
