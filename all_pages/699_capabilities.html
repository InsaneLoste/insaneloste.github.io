<p>The user can accelerate the age of themselves and others/objects with varying speeds/rates, as in, for example, age 2 years in one year, 5 in 3 years, 10 years in a day or even a year every 30 minutes. The user can make the aging automatic, so the victim ages at a rapid rate. If used offensively, the user can make beings and objects age to death, leaving nothing but dust. Because everything is subject to aging, this power could be used to destroy everything. The target may also be aged mentally to the point of senility.
