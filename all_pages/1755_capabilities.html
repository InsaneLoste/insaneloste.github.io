<p>The user can utilize the Armor Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around armored power. Armor can come in a variety of forms (simple, elaborate), be derived from specific sources (biology, outside matter, energy) and serve purposes ranging from mere defense to specialized combat to transportation. At its core, it is a covering meant to serve the passive function of protection; however, by engaging in specialized training, one can acquire supernatural skills that go far beyond standard aspects. One can learn to create or summon their own armor, often with the ability to customize it to their specifications. They can acquire personal enhancements to their physical abilities (durability, speed, strength) based on its unique qualities. They could even learn to remotely manipulate armor like a puppeteer, granting them a form of weaponization. Learning these arts can enable one the power to transform ordinary armor into a powerful tool to serve whatever purpose is needed.
