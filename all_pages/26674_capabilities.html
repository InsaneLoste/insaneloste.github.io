<p>The user can manipulate telekinetic force as <a href="/wiki/Tractor_Beam_Emission" title="Tractor Beam Emission">beams/rays</a>, <a href="/wiki/Telekinetic_Tethering" title="Telekinetic Tethering">fields</a> or appendages of pure will forming out of them and moving physical objects.Â It differs from <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" title="Telekinesis">Telekinesis</a> in that hand gestures, finger-pointing, or even in the form of invisible appendages, known only to the user of the ability are utilized more than a simple will of the mind. These telekinetic vectors carry with them a wave of telekinetic force that can tear physical matter to pieces, or even move quickly enough to pierce through it without causing any tangible harm, or be as precise as the simple cutting through a human skull while leaving the brain in tact. The strength of these telekinetic vectors is dependent on the user's ability to use them but can be as wielded with power enough to lift a semi-truck or rip a human in half. With training, this ability can become very versatile just like its more broad predecessor, allowing the user to shield themselves from harm, fly, or even use their "finger" to meddle inside the brain matter or physical body of others.
