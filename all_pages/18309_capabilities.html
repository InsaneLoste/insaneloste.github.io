<p>Users of this skill are thieves so great they are capable of stealing more than just physical items. They have honed their thieving skills to such heights that they make master thieves look like average pickpockets. They are capable of stealing physical objects without any direct contact, can steal powers and physical attributes from others, various energies, and are capable of breaking into and out of nearly any location and more.
