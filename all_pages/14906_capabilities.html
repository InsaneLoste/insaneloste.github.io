<p>User can make allies/friends with anyone/everyone regardless of who they are, even if they're trying to kill you or are working for your enemy/rival. This happens because the target has either a magnetic quality, an innocence or just some special trait that allows them to easily make allies with the worst of foes and the bitterest of loners. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Social_Magnetism" title="Social Magnetism">magnetism</a>, the user's power is not based on attraction/charisma or popularity.
