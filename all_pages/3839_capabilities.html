<p>Users possess the ability to impose the laws and physics of cartoons into reality, essentially allowing to warp the world around them however they see fit usually in a comedic fashion. Basically, cartoon physics is a jocular system of laws of physics (and biology) that supersedes the normal laws, used in animation for humorous effect. Most users can re-write the strict laws of physics in their universe to their convenience and is allowed to overwrite the laws with more lenient and much more absurd physics with much more ridiculous ones in service of hilarity.
