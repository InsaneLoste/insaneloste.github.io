<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_one-eyed_creatures_in_mythology_and_fiction" title="wikipedia:List of one-eyed creatures in mythology and fiction">cyclops</a> (plural: Cyclopes) or one-eyed humanoid. In mythology this trait was generally associated with fearsome creatures, in modern fiction some one-eyed creatures are likewise frightening enemies but others are friendly. It should be noted that Cyclops more accurately translates to "circle-eye" or "wheel-eye", referring to its size, therefore Cyclopean technically means huge, and not one-eyed (not to mention mythical Cyclops themselves were giants).
