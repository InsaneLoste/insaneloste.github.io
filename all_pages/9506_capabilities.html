<p>The user's apparent physiology is not its true physiology but instead a form of <a href="/wiki/Category:Object_Mimicry" title="Category:Object Mimicry">Object</a> or <a href="/wiki/Elemental_Mimicry" title="Elemental Mimicry">Elemental Mimicry</a>. Similar to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Defunct_Physiology" title="Defunct Physiology">Defunct Physiology</a>, the user derives no physical weakness from their body.  The body never needs breath, food, rest, nor other sustenance. They do not feel pain and cannot be poisoned or get ill. Often, the users are formed from inorganic matter (such as stone, metal or etc.) or animated flesh, bone, wood or other formerly living matter. A false physiology is not capable of reproducing, and it is rare for a false physiology to have any innate self-healing or regeneration capability (though it may be capable of mechanically re-attaching body parts through sewing, bolting, welding, gluing, etc.).  False physiologies come in several types.
