<p>The user either has or transformed their mind/brain/Intelligence into a conceptual one, increasing their mind to unbelievable levels.  Because of its abstract nature, they are not restricted to the conventional limitations of the normal mind, such as biological limits (example of not being dependent on the brain compared to some other consciousness are such as their senses) or psychological blocks of their frame of mind (example of understanding/comprehending abstract concepts compared to some other minds that may not be be able to understand the concept(s) entirely). For example, having a mind that is just as powerful as, if not more powerful than, an A.I. or a supercomputer or being immune to mental-based abilities. Advanced users can even give people, animals and/or object conceptual minds as well.
