The Tatzelwurm is one of the staple Cryptids of Europe, being the subject of countless sightings in Germany, Austria, Switzerland, Italy and France since the medieval age. The Tatzelwurm has been described as coming in a wide array of colors and patterns, some described it as being a black and bluish silver, green, brown, black and red, and some have even described it as having stripes like a tigerâ€™s.
