<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rave#Dancing" title="wikipedia:Rave">rave dancing</a>. Fueled by the unending focus on pulsating beats, loud volume and psychedelic music effects, dancers of rave music are free to create their freestyle of movements, with no rules about dance routines or synchronized moves, usually in dark and crowded venues of dance clubs, nightclubs, and festivals. Dancers are encouraged to find inspiration in music, other people, and their mood.
