<p>The user either is or can become a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Day_of_the_Dead" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Day of the Dead</a> entity, personification of the Day of the Dead and its variations. The powers of a user can differ greatly based upon what aspect of the holiday they take the shape of. They do not necessarily need to be one of the traditional holiday entities.
