<p>The user can transform into a giant monstrous sized werebeast. Depending on what type of werebeast the user is transforming into, the user is likely to transform into somewhat of a monstrous giant animal. Most users often possess superhuman levels of life energy, thus they’re able to not only use their life-force in their giant werebeast form but also use their giant werebeast form to make themselves stronger and more powerful, into near unstoppable werekaiju. Some users are only able to transform into giant werebeasts, but their werekaiju form still makes stronger and faster, and they’re still considered to be near-unstoppable werekaiju. Other users are able to harness the power of the werekaiju and use it to make themselves stronger, faster and more powerful, especially in hand-to-hand physical combat.
