<p>User can take and combine advantage of any type of something and make a new type with all those advantages that they could infuse themselves or others and other objects. For example, they can take both a type of leg and foot built for speed and mobility and take another type of leg and foot with stability, and combine them into one type that they can induce onto themselves or others.
