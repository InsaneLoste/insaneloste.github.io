<p>The user can avert any possible future, whether it be a general future or a future or something or someone, and cause them to not happen at all, making it so that another future happens instead of the one that is supposed to happen, but is instead averted. This also works on futures that are less certain than the one bound to happen, making those futures far less likely.
