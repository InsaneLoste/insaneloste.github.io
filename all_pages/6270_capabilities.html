<p>The users have/or possess the ability to manifest or generate two or multiple pairs of powerful wings on themselves at will as a natural feature of the ungodly/infernal species. Flight is an demon's wing's main function; however, it is not their only purpose as they also enable demons to teleport and travel to other planes and dimensions, possess healing and magical powers, aid in combat and are said to contain their demonic powers and immortality. So, if their wings were removed, they could be rendered a mortal human in certain worlds/fantasies. Demon wings, depending on the situation, can also be regenerated if removed. This, however, varies per fantasy world and mythology itself.
