<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kagura" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Kagura</a>, a specific type of Shinto ritual ceremonial dance. The phrase is a contraction of "kami no kura (seat of god)", indicating the presence of a god in the practice. One major function of Kagura is "Chinkon (purifying and shaking the spirit).", involving a procession-trance process. Usually, a female shaman will perform the dance and obtain the oracle from the god----in the setting, the dancer herself turns into a god during the performance. Once strictly a ceremonial art derived from <i>kami'gakari</i> (神懸 (かみがかり), "oracular divinification"), kagura has evolved in many directions over the span of more than a millennium. Today, it is very much a living tradition, with rituals tied to the rhythms of the agricultural calendar.
