<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Defendu" title="wikipedia:Defendu">defendu</a>, a martial arts style that encourages its practitioner to end a confrontation as quickly as possible and is also designed to be able to be mastered in mere days due to the extremely compressed curriculum using only several pragmatic and powerful strikes in boxing, wrestling, Savate, Jujutsu, Judo and street fighting. This martial art deals with "ungentlemanly" means by rapidly attacking vital spot area (such as the groin, throat, side of the neck, shin, eyes, ears, etc.)
