<p>The user can make the powers of themselves or others continue to carry on their effects independently without the need for them to put the slightest additional attention or effort onto said powers in order to make those effects last. E.g., if the user possesses <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" title="Telekinesis">Telekinesis</a> and tries to <a href="/wiki/Telekinetic_Choking" title="Telekinetic Choking">choke</a> their target in an attempt to kill them, they can make their power have the effects of the choking last until the victim of whom they intended to kill had finally died without the user him/herself needing to put any further effort at all into making said power kill their intended victim in the process.
