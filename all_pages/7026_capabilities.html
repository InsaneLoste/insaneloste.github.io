<p>Users can create, shape, absorb and manipulate draconic aura, a rare form of life-force that exists as an invisible etheric phenomenon/emanation produced by and surrounding a person or object that also has draconic properties. Some users obtain this power from absorbing the aura from dragons, learning from aura dragons or even coming from a long line of aura dragons. Because of its unique properties, the user can do many things that a normal aura cannot do, such as possessing near limitless aura, gaining unique power and/or abilities or even acquire dragon-like traits.
