<ul><li>The lethality of any given environment is relative, i.e. whether by sheer survivability, specific abilities suited to counter whatever makes the environment so lethal or some other factor, there may be beings/races who don't find the locale as inhospitable.</li>
<li>User may be unable creating lethal environment, being limited to manipulating already existing one.</li>
<li>Distance, mass, precision, etc. depend upon of the knowledge, skill, and strength of the user.</li></ul>
