<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raij%C5%AB" title="wikipedia:RaijÅ«">Raiju</a> ("thunder animal" or "thunder beast") whose body is composed of lightning and may be in the shape of a cat, fox, weasel, or wolf, with the form of a white and blue wolf (or even a wolf wrapped in lightning) being the most common. They may also fly about as a ball of lightning (in fact, the creature may be an attempt to explain the phenomenon of lightning) and their cry sounds like thunder.
