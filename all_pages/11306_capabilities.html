<p>Users either are or can take on the form/mimic the traits/gain the attributes of guns. The user's transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of guns, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
