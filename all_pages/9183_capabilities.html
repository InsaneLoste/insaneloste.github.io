<p>The user has exceptional and great skill in anything or something, whether physical or mental. The user thus has mastery over anything they have studied about it. With this, the user has mastered the skills they learned so well that they can even do things a normal, untrained person or even a superhuman cannot do, as they have talents and techniques that others are not able to learn off the bat. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Intuitive_Aptitude" title="Intuitive Aptitude">Intuitive Aptitude</a>, which is intuition based and just makes the user know what to do in a particular subject, this power makes it so that the user is further in experience and ability in terms of skill and being developed enough to do what they can do.
