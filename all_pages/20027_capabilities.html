<p>User can create, shape and manipulate weather of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Weather Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiment of weather. As such, they can cause natural weather effects such as rainstorms, sunbreaks, and droughts to occur. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Weather Manipulation as weather is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunities &amp; resistances to weather-based abilities.
