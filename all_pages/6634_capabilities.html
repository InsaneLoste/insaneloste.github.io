<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a Direction Deity, a god/goddess who represents and is associated with directions, locations, navigation, maps, cartography, and “the way”, and all their aspects. This grants them absolute knowledge and power over them, their concepts and principles. Directional Deities were a somewhat common feature of worship in polytheistic religions, and they can be found in recorded history in various forms.
