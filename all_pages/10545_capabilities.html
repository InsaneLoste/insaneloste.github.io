<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy" title="wikipedia:Galaxy">galaxies</a>; massive astronomical objects consisting of stars, compact stars, planets, dark matter, matter, energy, black holes, nebulas, clusters, planetary systems, etc., in the visible universe. Galaxies are maintained by the gravitational attraction of celestial objects within them. They can vary in size, appearance, and formation, from <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dwarf_galaxy" title="wikipedia:Dwarf galaxy">dwarf galaxies</a> resembling nebulas with illuminated centers to massive galaxies similar to the milky way, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiral_galaxy" title="wikipedia:Spiral galaxy">spiral galaxies</a>, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptical_galaxy" title="wikipedia:Elliptical galaxy">elliptical galaxies</a>, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lenticular_galaxy" title="wikipedia:Lenticular galaxy">lenticular galaxies</a>. Galaxies are one of the most massive and prominent objects that complement the universe of its vastness. Due to manipulating galaxies, they can control everything within them, from cosmological forces or fundamental forces on a galactic level, construct dwarf to supermassive galaxies, and even destroy them, along with everything within. With enough expertise, the user can control <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_group" title="wikipedia:Galaxy group">galaxy groups</a>, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Galaxy_cluster" title="wikipedia:Galaxy cluster">clusters</a>, and <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Supercluster" title="wikipedia:Supercluster">superclusters</a>. The user can mimic universal manipulation by commanding colossal quantities of galaxies and gaining tremendous power from them.
