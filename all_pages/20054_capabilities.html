<p>Users can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability" title="wikipedia:Probability">probability</a>, how likely an event is to occur, and or how likely it is that a proposition is true. They can decide how likely events happen, making unlikely things occur more often or instantly and preventingÂ liable events from happening. They can cause and prevent both good and bad luck, sudden deaths, natural disasters, and even apocalyptic events.
