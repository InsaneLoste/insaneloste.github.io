<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a chiko or are one, in popular culture they are often referred to more commonly as nogitsune and are the most powerful rank an evil kitsune can achieve. They have a wide array of wicked powers at their disposal and are much more cruel and prone to acts of violence than other kitsune, for this reason they cannot achieve higher ranks in kitsune society, the most powerful chiko to ever manifest was the godlike monster known as Tamamo no Mae, who was considered the "queen of evil kitsune" and one of Japan's greatest threats, however she was also an exception to the rule as most chiko are powerful but by no means transcendent, due to their evil nature. Another example is Daji, one of the greatest threats China has ever faced.
