<p>Users are incredibly skilled at harming others, whether intentionally or unintentional. Users have no problem using any means to get their way with others, even if it involves breaking a few bones or leaving some scars. They don't necessarily have to be good at fighting or killing to be violent, however, the intention to harm has to be there, which usually does lead to the deaths or maiming of others.
