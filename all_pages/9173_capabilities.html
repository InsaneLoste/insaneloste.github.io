<p>User can absorb and replicate any materials and then upgrade any materials, abilities, powers, or miscellaneous things that they've absorbed, and replicate them in their evolved form. For example, the user could absorb a steam engine and turn it into a nuclear reactor (steam engine =&gt; upgrade =&gt; nuclear reactor). Like with <a href="/wiki/Evolving_Power_Replication" title="Evolving Power Replication">Evolving Power Replication</a>, the user can also "branch out" with these materials, changing them into something else marginally related to it or turning it into something less advanced or powerful -- an example would be absorbing an airplane and turning it into a glider (airplane =&gt; downgrade =&gt; glider) or vise versa.
