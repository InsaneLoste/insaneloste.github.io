<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate elemental forces derived from various dinosaurs and dinosaur like creatures. These dinosaurs possess natural powers (such as air, fire, water, earth, etc.) that the user can access and control according to their will. Because of their unique nature, the elements being manipulated may have special aspects and effects not normally found elsewhere, either in the natural world or among other elemental power users.
