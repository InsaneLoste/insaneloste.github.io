<p>The user is able to merge different places/environments into one whole place. User could take a flower-filled meadow and barren volcanic area, and merge them into a place that has features of both a meadow and volcanic field. Other examples include an ocean floor (and water) and a rocky desert area. In the case of merging cities together, buildings from one city may merge with the buildings of another, or be separate altogether.
