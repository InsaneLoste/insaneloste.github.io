<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gunpowder" title="wikipedia:Gunpowder">gunpowder</a>, a powdery chemical explosive that was mainly used as propellant in early firearms. Gunpowder can be used as physical matter to build constructs and capture enemies, but can also be detonated to inflict incendiary damage. Skilled users can detonate gunpowder at minuscule scales to provide a propellant thrust for projectiles or flight.
