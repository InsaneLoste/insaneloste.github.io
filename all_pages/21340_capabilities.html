<p>Users can enter a permanent state of rebirth upon resurrection; in death users are reborn into a newer, better and more enhanced version of themselves, when they are being resurrected as theyâ€™re entire existence is redefined, during the process, any and all characteristics and features of their existence (body, mind, soul, abilities, nature, parameters, properties, aspects, etc.) can increase their traits, capabilities and even enhance them completely.
