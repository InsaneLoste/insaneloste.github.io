<p>The user can move on all fours with pressure being taken by the knuckles like a primate with ease. <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Knuckle-walking" title="wikipedia:Knuckle-walking">Knuckle-walking</a> is a form of quadrupedal walking in which the forelimbs hold the fingers in a partially flexed posture that allows body weight to press down on the ground through the knuckles. Gorillas and chimpanzees use this style of locomotion as do anteaters and platypuses.
