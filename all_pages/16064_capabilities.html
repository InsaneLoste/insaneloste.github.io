<p>User can adapt to styles of motion/move in any position, allowing them to utilize even the most unorthodox of styles of positions in movement regardless of the physical properties/forces, no matter how inefficient/ineffective it normally is, without losing speed. They can climb/run/walk/swim/etc. in a way/position that would be too slow to use due to how inefficient it is. These positions are mostly limited to the movement they are associated with, such as standing and running positions for running, crawling based positions for crawling only, etc.
