<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate lightning that's highly effective against the supernatural, such as demons and/or angels or, in special cases, a form of control over the element especially used from deities associated with sky/storm/thunder to fulfill various feats. The effectiveness can range from <a href="/wiki/Binding" title="Binding">trapping and/or immobilizing</a> to outright <a href="/wiki/Banishment" title="Banishment">banishing</a> or <a href="/wiki/Death_Inducement" title="Death Inducement">killing</a> supernatural threats, even powerful enough that it can also be used to harm even a deity. Furthermore, divine lightning may have other properties and abilities, such as <a href="/wiki/Healing" title="Healing">healing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Resurrection" title="Resurrection">Resurrection</a>, summoning <a href="/wiki/Angel_Physiology" title="Angel Physiology">angels</a> and/or spirits of the deceased from Heaven to the material plane.
