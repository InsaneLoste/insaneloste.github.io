<p>The user is unaffected by the effects of relativistic velocities, including time dilation, velocity addition, length contraction and even mass increasing when speed increases, up to infinity at light speed. They are immune to being at zero mass, which would automatically make them move off at light speed, as light tends to move at its speed when it comes into existence.
