<p>The user can accelerate the kinetic movement of molecules, be it their own or another's. They can speed up an object's molecules, causing them to become disordered to the point of activation, ignition, melting, oscillation or vaporization.  The user can also accelerate molecules to the point that they strike a target with such speed that said target is ripped apart.
