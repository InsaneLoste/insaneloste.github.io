<p>Users of this ability can take on the traits of a kilmoulis (or are one), a benevolent type of brownie from Northumbrian folklore that is perhaps one of the strangest fairy kin, resembling ugly old men with no mouths and gigantic noses that take up almost the entirety of their face to the point they must inhale food via their nose. Despite their hideous appearance, kilmoulises are generally hard-working creatures, but, like all fairies, also enjoy tricks and pranks.
