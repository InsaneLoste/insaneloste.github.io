<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Femtotechnology" title="wikipedia:Femtotechnology">Femtomites</a>, machines or robots whose components are at or near the scale of a femtometre. Theoretical devices ranging in size from the scale of trillionths of a meter or femtoscale 10^(-15) to 10^(-17) m. Usually fabricated from picoscale or atomic level outward. Such an effect enables users to manipulate the meta matter state on a particle to subquantum scale.
