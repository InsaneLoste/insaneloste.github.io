<p>The user can sense and become aware whenever reality is altered by <a href="/wiki/Reality_Warping" title="Reality Warping">Reality Warping</a>. This allows them to be aware if, for example, if the entire Continent of Europe turned into South America, even if they themselves are not there. No matter where the user is, they will know when a reality warper has changed reality.
