<p>Users can create and control constructs capable of consuming matter and energy, said constructs can consume just about anything and their appetites could very well be limitless. These constructs can manifest in different forms and objects of varying detail and permanence, ranging from simple shapes and images, to individual elements, substances and materials, to functional items such as tools and weapons, to more complex creations such as living or non-living entities, entire structures and even environments in certain cases. Depending on their control over the source of their constructs, those who have mastered this ability can use it for almost any situation, creating anything they need.
