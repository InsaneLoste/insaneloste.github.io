<p>User can create, shape and manipulate air of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Air Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiment of air. As such, they can cause natural air effects such as tornadoes, hurricanes, and wind storms to manifest. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Air Manipulation as air is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunities &amp; resistances to air based abilities.
