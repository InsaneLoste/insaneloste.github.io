<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate consequences, result of actions and effects. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Outcome_Manipulation" title="Outcome Manipulation">Outcome Manipulation</a>, this power mainly affects the consequences of just actions, and the power does not affect possible results, but the number of consequences that do happen from an action. Also, the consequences may or may not be linked or related to the action, such a punch to a person affecting the stability of the whole universe. How to get each consequence may not be controllable as well. This power is more action-consequence based, making it karma based.
