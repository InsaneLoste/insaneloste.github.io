<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chimera_(mythology)" title="wikipedia:Chimera (mythology)">chimera</a>, a fire-breathing ferocious, mythological hybrid from Greek Mythology, composed of the parts of three animals â€” a lion, a snake and a goat. Usually depicted as a lion, with the head of a goat arising from its back, and a tail that ends in a snake's head, although more regent descriptions add a dragon to the amalgamation, which may affect the type of breath-weapon they have. Chimeras are extremely dangerous, and are often depicted in mythology as one of the most ferocious, powerful and deadly creatures of all time.
