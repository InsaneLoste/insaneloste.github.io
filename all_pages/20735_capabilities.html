<p>The user can utilize <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_tunneling" title="wikipedia:Quantum tunneling">quantum tunneling</a>, a quantum mechanics phenomenon where a particle (or in this case the user) can pass through potential barriers. The process of quantum tunneling has the particle/user act like a wave function which allows the user to have the probability of appearing on the other side of a potential barrier.
