<p>User has multiple minds (and/or souls) in many/multiple bodies that are all connected to and shared between each other. This allows them to work collectively for the whole of the group and allows each member to act as a parallel processor. They act like a normal hive mind, but they can also have multiple different minds/souls/consciousness in each of their bodies as well.
