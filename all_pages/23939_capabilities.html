<p>Users can utilize the Dynamic Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around physical power. Practitioners of this discipline can perform various feats related with power/brute force allowing them to manifest various feats ranging from simple augmented strength to altering reality on sheer might alone. The source of this strength can come from various sources, and this may add extra effects to one's strength and strikes (such as absorbing fire to boost strength and being able to burn opponents).
