<p>The user can utilize the Entity Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around entity power. Entities come in a variety of forms (animals/beasts, spirits, deities, demons). They can be natural, supernatural, domestic, extra-dimensional, native, extraterrestrial or have characteristics not found within the scope of any known categorization or classification. To that end, one who engages in specialized practices pertaining to certain beings can potentially gain preternatural abilities. This can range from drawing power from certain beings to summoning them from wherever (and possibly) whenever they are, creating entities or even being able to transform into certain entities, altering their form to suit whatever needs or desires the user has. The only possible limits to the nature and number of techniques could be the overall nature of the entities involved in the process.
