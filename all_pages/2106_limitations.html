<ul><li>The targets may be able to <a href="/wiki/Attraction_%26_Repulsion_Defiance" title="Attraction &amp; Repulsion Defiance">resist</a> this power if they are powerful enough to go the opposite direction in the same manner as moving against a current.</li>
<li>Could prove hazardous if you pull in too much or pull harmful things toward you.</li>
<li>Has a limited range. The further away from the center of the field, the less powerful the pull is.</li>
<li>It's difficult to get away from the people you don't like.</li>
<li>Multiple fields can create multiple problems. If you are not immune to your own powers, the extra fields become an obstacle or hinderance. Many fields at once can limit or divide the amount of power is in the pull (i.e. 2 fields cut the power in half, 4 into quarter power ect.)</li></ul>
