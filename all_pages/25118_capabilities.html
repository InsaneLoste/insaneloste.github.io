<p>User can isolate themselves or others from most temporal effects while still existing inside of the timestream. The power is like a big stone in a river, the water being the flow of time and the stone being a part of the river while also isolated from most of its effects, the water must pass by the stone while it just sits there and ignores the waters effects. this works under the same basic concept. This allows them to ignore temporal effects such as <a href="/wiki/Temporal_Rewind" title="Temporal Rewind">rewinding</a>, <a href="/wiki/Time_Reduction" title="Time Reduction">reduction</a>, <a href="/wiki/Time_Stopping" title="Time Stopping">stopping</a>, <a href="/wiki/Time_Acceleration" title="Time Acceleration">acceleration</a>, and even <a href="/wiki/Age_Shifting" title="Age Shifting">shifting</a>.
