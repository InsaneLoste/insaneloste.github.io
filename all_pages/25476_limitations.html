<ul><li>May be unable to create titanium, being limited to manipulating only from already existing sources.</li>
<li>Distance, mass, precision, etc. depend upon of the knowledge, skill, and strength of the user, and their power's natural limits.</li>
<li>Titanium is affected by everything that normal titanium would be, although the user is perfectly able to use their power to return the titanium in its original shape and/or controlling it even under these forces:
<ul><li>Melt under extreme heat (<a href="/wiki/Fire_Manipulation" title="Fire Manipulation">Fire Manipulation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Magma_Manipulation" title="Magma Manipulation">Magma Manipulation</a>).</li>
<li>Turn brittle and shatter under extreme cold (<a href="/wiki/Freezing" title="Freezing">Freezing</a>).</li>
<li>Pure titanium is incredibly brittle and will eventually break under strain.</li></ul></li>
<li>By itself Titanium is very brittle, it requires fusion with other metallic elements to maintain resilience as well as acquire new structural properties.</li></ul>
