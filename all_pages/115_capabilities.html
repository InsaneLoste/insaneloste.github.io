<p>User embodies the state of being complete or absolute. Being complete means having all the necessary or appropriate parts so this power does not mean you embody everything just things of an absolute nature. Because of the users absolute nature they are free from any thing that would be deemed superfluous or wasteful. This translates to the user being without any weaknesses or limitations.
