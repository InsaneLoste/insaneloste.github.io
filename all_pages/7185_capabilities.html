They possess intuitive pharmaceutical and chemical knowledge of drugs and how they affect the human body. Due to their large mental library of what drugs do what, they know what drugs to administer to treat a person, how to make it, and how potent the effects can be.   One with this ability can make drugs with nearly anything in one's environments. They are also able to tell which things in the wild (or in oneâ€™s kitchen) are poisonous and which are safe to ingest.  Users can perfectly and without a single flaw or mistake make any and every type of drug there is was and will ever be whenever they want with zero effort by themselves in a short amount of time.
