<p>User is immune to decay, rotting, etc., being completely invulnerable to direct and indirect decaying effects. To put it simply, the user's body could still die, yet the condition of their corpse would forever remain intact. Bones and muscle won't crumble nor turn to ash, skin and flesh sustain their freshness, with virtually all the body retaining it's strength.
