<p>Users can move faster than the peak members of their species, making it very difficult for one to be able to react to them. The users of this ability are also very resistant or even outright immune to the side effects of moving at such speeds. These effects include, but are not limited to, g-force, inertia, intense heat build-up, massive kinetic energy build-up, etc. They are capable of running 64-616 km/h (40-383 MPH).
