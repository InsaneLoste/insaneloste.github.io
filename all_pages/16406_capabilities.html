<p>The user possesses an unstable form of evolution, in which their physiology mutates as it provides them with various <a href="/wiki/Self-Power_Bestowal" title="Self-Power Bestowal">new powers</a> and <a href="/wiki/Self-Power_Augmentation" title="Self-Power Augmentation">heightened abilities</a>. The mutations can also allow the user to adapt to different situations, threats, environments, etc. However, the user could go insane/berserk from the reconfiguration of their physical form if capability is overused or they have uncontrollable mutation processes.
