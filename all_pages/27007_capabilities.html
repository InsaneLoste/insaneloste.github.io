<p>The user can create, shape, and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wall" title="wikipedia:Wall">walls</a>, including length, width, durability, the materials that the walls are made of, etc. Users can connect multiple walls together to create blockades, thus blocking off anything caught in-between them, or protect themselves by forming walls around themselves. Users can also manipulate existing walls, moving them apart to tear apart other buildings.
