<p>The user is a non-created being with no beginning/origin at all, as they were always there before existence. This means they didn't simply <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Causa_Sui_Physiology" title="Causa Sui Physiology">create themselves</a>Â nor were they created by someone else or even come into existence. Rather, they have always existed in some form or another. As they have no beginning or ending of any kind, they are completely <a href="/wiki/Freedom" title="Freedom">free</a> from the control or influence of any being and even the <a href="/wiki/Grand_Design_Construction" title="Grand Design Construction">grand design</a>.
