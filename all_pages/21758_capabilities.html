<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into an organite mass consciousness. They are comprised of a shared phalanx of a sentient gestalt cellular/organic micromachine collective, or are otherwise a singular intelligence sequestered upon billions to trillions of self-aware bio computers. The infinite DNA/RNA helix's of such an existence can store &amp; index any and all information copied onto it, through which users can recreate everything from the compartmentalized information from scratch if need be. With modifications to the codecs implemented in their fabrication.
