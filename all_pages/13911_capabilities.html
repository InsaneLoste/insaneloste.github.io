<p>The user can ignore how levers in physics work. Levers are a kind of simple machine, and can be used to move things, including parts of or all of the human body. They are normally used for either speed or strength, but this power allows levers in the human body to be used for both speed and strength, making the user faster and stronger. Basically, this allows for a combination of all three classes of levers.
