<p>The user can utilize the Interaction Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around fundamental power. The fundamental forces are the most basic and essential interactions that define the physical makeup of reality. They are largely responsible for the manifestation and maintenance of universal matter and energy. Each one governs a different yet important set of scientifically-defined phenomena. By learning specialized techniques related to them, one is capable of attaining incredible power. From gravity (attraction, repulsion, singularities) to electromagnetism (electricity, EM spectrum, magnetism), strong force (particle manipulation, stabilization, transmutation) to weak force (destabilization, radioactive decay, solar energy), any one of the fundamental forces allows for amazing abilities.
