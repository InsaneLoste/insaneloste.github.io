<li>Sometimes, the user's skin is rendered permanently white or gray and the hair rendered permanently black, even producing artificial face paint, and/or rendering the user mute (In such a case, the user would require a power like <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">Telepathy</a> or <a href="/wiki/Empathy" title="Empathy">Empathy</a> in order to communicate). Though, fortunately, in other cases, the transformation only lasts as long as the power is in use.</li></ul>
