<p>User can bind two or more targets together by various means. When they are bonded together, the victims will not be able to move much distance away from each other. As long as they are bound to one another, they will be forced to move in unison if they are to get anywhere. The means of bonding the victims may include chains, telekinesis or some other force, ropes, magic, energy or other means.
