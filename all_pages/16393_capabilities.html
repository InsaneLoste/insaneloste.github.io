<p>The user is a vampire that has been mutated into a monstrous aberration of what they should be. Mutant vampire are the direct opposite of Metavampires, which happen to have possessed powers through natural genetic or modification even if mutations are relatively minor. Mutated vampires, however, are severely mutated yet have lost their physiology.
