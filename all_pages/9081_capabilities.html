<p>Users are in a state of constant and endless transcendence, transcending one's unique state of being, existence, nature, capabilities, abilities, etc., to the infinity with no limit or restriction to their potential. Users are continuously transcending things like concepts and/or the various levels of reality endlessly, <a href="/wiki/Rule_Transcendence" title="Rule Transcendence">breaking free from the laws, principles, or rules that make up any reality</a>, seeing all lower levels of reality as if they were nonexistent fiction and all <a href="/wiki/Conceptual_Transcendence" title="Conceptual Transcendence">transcended concepts</a> as if they're meaningless.
