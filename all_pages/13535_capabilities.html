<p>The user can use kinetic energy to <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" title="Telekinesis">telekinetically</a> affect the direct atomic motion of matter/energy in general; effectively making them able to move, manipulate or otherwise interact with the direction of minutia motion in any given vector they see fit. In time becoming able to control substance by directing it's micro-particle movement parameter through their abilities, more powerful wielders of this ability being able to effect movement and kinetic energy on a more theoretical scale like the motion of time, etc.
