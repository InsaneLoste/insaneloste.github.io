<p>User can utilize <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spiritualism" title="wikipedia:Spiritualism">spiritualism</a>, a belief-system/religion postulating that the belief of spirits of the dead residing in the spirit world have both the ability and the inclination to communicate with the living. Anyone may receive spirit messages, but formal communication sessions (s√©ances) are held by "<a href="/wiki/Mediumship" title="Mediumship">mediums</a>", who can then provide information about the afterlife.
