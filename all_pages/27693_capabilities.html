<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Yamachichi or are one, a Yamachichi is one of two possible evolutionary forms of the Nobusu and takes the form of a large monkey-like humanoid that will invade human homes in the cover of night and feed upon the life-force of victims as they sleep, if a victim doesn't wake in time the spirit will finish by tapping them on the chest and they will die within a day, however if a victim wakes in time they can disrupt its feeding and their life will be magically extended instead.
