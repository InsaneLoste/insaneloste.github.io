<p>User has prehensile arm parts, capable of being used like an extra pair of hands, granting them an increased level of wall climbing, combat, dexterity, balance, agility, reflexes, strength, speed, endurance, and equilibrium maneuverability in environments. The user can also manipulate objects easily with their arms. The user does not need to use the hands connected to their arms to manipulate anything. While arms are usually able to carry things on their own, this power uses parts of an arm, such as the forearm, hind arm or elbow, rather than using the whole arm to say, wrap and carry something.
