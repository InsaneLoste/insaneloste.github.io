<p>The user can utilize the Quantum Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around quantum physics. Quantum physics explain the behavior of matter and its interactions with energy on a microscopic scale. The interactions in this scale are mostly unpredictable, as particles interact differently in contrast to macroscopic material due to the complexity of quantum mechanics and the universe's fundamental interactions occurring at this level. Quantum is described as the minimum bases of matter-energy interaction to occur inside a physical entity. Quantum mechanics and physics contains the smallest pieces of matter and energy that enable the formation of larger material such as planets.
