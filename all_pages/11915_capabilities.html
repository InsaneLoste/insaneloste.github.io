As such, they normally are based on sight and potentially also <a href="/wiki/Sound_Sculpting" title="Sound Sculpting">sound</a>, but normally have no effect to other senses or any true physical presence. However, advanced enough holograms are powerful enough to simulate tangibility and become solid enough to interact both sensorially and physically with their environment.
