<ul><li>A superpower without an if...then... structure cannot be affected by this power. This applies to any powers that does not specify a fixed condition to be met, this usually means the simpler powers such as the element manipulation powers (Fire, Water, Earth, Air, Time, Gravity, Space etc.), or some powers with a general outcome that does not care about the nature of the target (e.g. A power which turn everything into gold)</li>
<li>Since this power itself is also based on an if...then... structure (the if condition is "indirect, not literal"), the irony is that a sufficiently creative user can still counter it or render if useless against them by another subtle wordplay such that the indirect condition becomes direct (See the example of unrestricted murdering above)</li>
<li>Useless against some omnipotent users (as long they are aware being attacked), where there always exist a method to make indirect concepts direct.</li>
<li>Useless against powers that make use of uncertainty such as <a href="/wiki/Uncertainty_Manipulation" title="Uncertainty Manipulation">Uncertainty Manipulation</a>, since uncertainty can be pretty much anything that is not understood</li>
<li>This power has a radius of effect of 10 general units (meters, levels, orders of causation, probability, year, etc.), anything outside it will ceased to be affected</li>
<li>A very subtle way to combat this power is manipulating history, since some aspect of this power relies on how the meaning of concepts evolve over the course of history (for example it's effect against <a href="/wiki/Author_Authority" title="Author Authority">Author Authority</a>), as some aspect of this power is actually enforcing the earliest (or narrowest) definition of the concept (e.g. possession, authorship, existence etc.) based on human or other intelligent lifeforms history of development.</li>
<li>This power can have unintented side effects when interacting with some powers such as <a href="/wiki/Irreversible_Destruction" title="Irreversible Destruction">Irreversible Destruction</a>, which will empower it by removing the indirect countermeasure against it such as "undoing the damage by regression to a point before it is done"</li></ul>
