<p>The user can treat gases, liquids, vacuum, etc. as if they were a solid surface, using it to swing around like a gymnastics pole, sit on air, etc. allowing movements that usually require a solid surface. They can even stand up straight even without legs on the ground or being on one leg, and they can float in the air with the gas (such as air), liquid (such as water) or vacuum supporting their weight like the medium was a solid without pushing through them.
