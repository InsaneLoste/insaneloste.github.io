<p>Users possess <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Extrasensory_perception" title="wikipedia:Extrasensory perception">extrasensory perception</a>; essentially a sixth sense that allows them to acquire information by means independent of any of their known senses or previous experience. This applies to any and all kinds of information, knowledge, wisdom, experience, etc. Information can be either personal (memories, thoughts, etc.) or impersonal (academic knowledge, data, etc.). This ability can be used passively (as an instinctual reaction) or actively (by wanting to know specific information).
