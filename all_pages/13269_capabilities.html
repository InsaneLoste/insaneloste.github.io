<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ionizing_radiation" title="wikipedia:Ionizing radiation">ionizing radiation</a>. They are generated when <a href="/wiki/Radiation_Manipulation" title="Radiation Manipulation">radiation</a> has energy to liberate electrons from atoms or molecules, thereby ionizing them. Radioactive isotopes such as gamma rays, x-rays, and higher-tier ultraviolet rays are considered forms of ionizing radiation. Due to the unstable nature of ionic rays, ionizing radiation can have many negative effects on living organisms, causing things like <a href="/wiki/Cancer_Inducement" title="Cancer Inducement">cancer</a>, <a href="/wiki/Disease_Generation" title="Disease Generation">radiation sickness</a>, <a href="/wiki/Cellular_Disintegration" title="Cellular Disintegration">cell damage</a>, <a href="/wiki/Burning" title="Burning">radiation burns</a>, and even <a href="/wiki/Death_Inducement" title="Death Inducement">death</a>.
