<p>User can change between replicas of themselves, whether they are alike or very different, and thus change who is the original user out of the replicas, down to the essence. This mostly works on living beings, but it can also work on inorganic replicas. Even the history and life of the replica they shift into will change so that they are the original one. This can work in replicas that may have different powers. To sum it up in other words, the replica of the user becomes the real deal as if they were always the real user and the original body becomes a replica.
