While descriptions of these creatures vary wildly, most agree that they are small animals with a mirror or gem set in their foreheads. These gems are generally described as red and glow like fire in the dark, but carbuncles have a lid, hood, or curtain they can use to cover their gems when necessary. They are usually quadrupeds but have occasionally been observed with more legs.
