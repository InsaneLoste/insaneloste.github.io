<p>Users of this ability can take on the traits of a Bauk (or are one), the Bauk is a malicious bear-like monster found in Serbian folklore that would hide in dark or abandoned places and wait for victims to stray too close before attacking and trying to devour them - while they are similar to the Bugbears they had greater range and also a deep fear of light or noise, which would cause them to flee.
