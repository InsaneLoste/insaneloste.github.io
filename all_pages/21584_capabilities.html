<p>User can transcend any and all laws rules that make up reality. Instead of breaking the rules of any system, they are out in out surpassing them. For example, say there is an ironclad rule that states that one cannot go above a certain rank of divinity. Users of this power can transcend that and reach the status of an almighty being or escape from a place that not only has no exits but the inhabitants there can actually force them to stay. The users are not only able to escape but can also prevent themselves from being taken back.
