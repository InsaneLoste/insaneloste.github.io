<p>The user can, while running on ceilings, jump and land back onto the ceiling instead of falling to the ground as if defying gravity. It is as if the ceiling is pulling the user to them, instead of the ground. The user can also do moves that involve leaving the ground, such as flips and aerial cartwheels, on ceilings without falling to the ground.
