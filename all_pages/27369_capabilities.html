<p>A user with this ability is able to become a Wereleopard, with the ability to transform into a leopard or an anthropomorphic hybrid. Unlike werewolves, they aren't particularly connected to the moon or have any weakness for silver or their other traditional weaknesses. The user gains the traits of Wereleopards, most obvious being ability to change into a leopard with the natural characteristics inherent to both leopard and humans, including senses, stamina, agility, etc.
