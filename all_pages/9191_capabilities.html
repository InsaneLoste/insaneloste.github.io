<p>The user can manipulate exercise and training as well as the movements and actions involved in it. They may compel other characters to exercise via <a href="/wiki/Motor-Skill_Manipulation" title="Motor-Skill Manipulation">Motor-Skill Manipulation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Command_Inducement" title="Command Inducement">Command Inducement</a>. Alternately, users may slow or accelerate the benefits of exercise such that an arduous, protracted <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Training_Regimen" title="Training Regimen">Training Regimen</a> produces little benefit, or that massive gains are relized through a superficial training regimen.
