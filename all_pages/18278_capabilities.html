<p>Users are glaringly, obviously and super stealthier than their race because their capabilities peak human level; making them immensely stealthier and making them harder to spot than the most dedicated trainers. They can hide behind things that are smaller than them and they can go unnoticed in a crowd full of people, for example. They can use strategic plans to gather information though places surrounded with enemies by moving quick and quietly with agility to climb buildings, cling to walls or corners making it hard for enemies to find them. This also allows them to adapt to the darkness to stay hidden, unseen, and unheard to strike at enemies once a time before getting spotted, followed, or traced, and would need to retreat either into shadows or long distances from treats. The user possesses incredibly extensive knowledge and skill in many types and ways of stealth tactics, enabling them to easily slip in and out of areas undetected. Their abilities in all manners of stealth are so refined they appear as mere illusions to those who have been lucky to spot the user. The users of this ability can move throughout even the most guarded of areas and act in true discretion.
