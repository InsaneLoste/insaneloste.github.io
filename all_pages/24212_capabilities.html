<p>The character is a ghost with well-rounded arcane powers and magical power. These abilities may be the result of magic ghosts being <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Magician" title="Archetype:Magician">Human Mages</a> before they were turned, or theyÂ were descendants from a long line of witches and warlocks and have been turned. Due to their magical abilities, ghost mages are much stronger than other ghosts of similar physiology. Indeed a ghost mage of relatively weak physiology will still be more powerful that a non-user of magic who has <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Superior_Ghost_Physiology" title="Superior Ghost Physiology">Superior Ghost Physiology</a>, and a ghost archmage will be even more dangerous. As a result, ghost mages often dominate other ghosts and become a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Alpha_Ghost_Physiology" title="Alpha Ghost Physiology">ghost lord</a>. They can also be much more intelligent than their regular peers, but this is not an assured thing.
