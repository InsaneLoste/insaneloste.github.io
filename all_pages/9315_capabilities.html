<p>The user is able to make anything explode or combust by saying the name of the desired subject at hand. By calling the title of an object, the user can cause that object to explode, regardless of what amount of that object is present at the moment. For example, in the situation a user is surrounded by opponents wearing helmets, all they would need to say is the word "Helmets" to make every helmet present randomly explode.
