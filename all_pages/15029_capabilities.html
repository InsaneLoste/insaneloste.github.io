<p>The user can utilize the Manifested Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around manifested power. Various supernatural force users are capable of exhibiting their power through attacks, combat, defense, healing, binding or even sealing. While many are simply able to perform fairly standard skills, there are unique practices where one’s esoteric essence is actually designed to resemble a particular shape. It can be easily recognizable like an animal or a weapon or have unique meaning such as resembling a special symbol. The power demonstrated, by virtue of being shaped, allows the user to wield heightened levels of preternatural potency that would normally be unavailable in its standard form. Attacks can be faster or more forceful. Defenses can be stronger. Bindings can be more restrictive. The limits to the power of one’s techniques are only limited by one’s ideas.
