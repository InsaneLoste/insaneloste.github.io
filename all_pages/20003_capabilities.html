<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate metal of an ancient primordial nature, the same metal from the beginning of the universe to ahead. Users of this ability are either deities, avatars or living embodiment of metal. As such, the users can of course have total control over common metals and even metals from other worlds. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Metal Manipulation as metal is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunities &amp; resistances to metal-based abilities.
