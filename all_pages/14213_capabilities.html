<p>Users can summon lightning bolts from the sky or project them from their own bodies (usually from owns hands), using them to pierce and/or severely burn their opponents even to the point of death. Unlike normal bolts of lightning, they could use them as concussive or even piercing forces, which could be strong enough to affect even greater beings of strength and durability.
