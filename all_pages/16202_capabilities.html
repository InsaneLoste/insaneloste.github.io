<p>The user can do multiple actions in one go. This does not mean they move necessarily fast. While they can move so fast if that is what they do, they also can accelerate their bodies to do such actions more quickly than others, which allow them to outpace others, even if they match in speed overall. These actions can be attacks, movements, defensive actions, tasks, etc.
