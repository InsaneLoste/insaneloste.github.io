They can hear any sound at any volume or pitch, know the exact location of how far it is, following and seeking any distance to know where the noises come from. They can see what is happening at further distances, even though solid surfaces. They can smell or taste anything they come across, knowing the exact details of the scent being tracked, traced, and carried. They can feel the texture of objects they have a telekinetic hold on, to feel when other objects/subjects come into contact with them.
