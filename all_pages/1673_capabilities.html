<p>The user can have the traits and abilities of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Archangel" title="wikipedia:Archangel">archangels</a> (literally <i>chief angel</i>), angel lords who herald other angels. They possess incredible supernatural power and dominion over other angels and at times given charge over a specific area or function. On top of their gargantuan personal power, they usually rule over their own divine plane and its legions of angels as chief princes/princesses, making them some of the most powerful defenses against the unholy legions.
