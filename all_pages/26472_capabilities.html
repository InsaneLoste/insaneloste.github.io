<p>The user can cause their own or other beings' properties, attributes or anything with magnitudes to become unreachable, making it so that no matter how much they increase whatever it is that is affected by this power, the user or other being never reaches the magnitude of whatever they have, and thus stay at a lower magnitude or keep on pushing just to never reach what they are trying to get at.
