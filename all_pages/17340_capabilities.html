<p>Users of this skill have access to a gun of unlimited power as well as skill enough to use them, these firearms are of a truly cosmic quality and can strike down normally invulnerable entities, even those of godlike scale - while such weapons are immensely useful in dealing with extremely powerful opponents they often come with a catch, such as being severely unstable or causing lasting damage to the user - (this is normally done as a kind of plot-device, since access to such powerful weapons would otherwise make a character nigh-invincible due to the sheer destructive force at hand).
