<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into ball or balls. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of balls, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
