the chemical properties and processes related to the element, carbon, particularly with the transformation of coals into specialized products like fuels. Carbon is one of the most abundant elements on the planet and in the entire universe by mass. It comes in many forms, ranging from brittle graphite to dense diamond. Coal, a mostly carbon-based sedimentary rock, is created from decomposing plant matter that is put through pressure and heat. Through treatment processes like carbonization (converting material to carbon through heating techniques), gasification (converting carbon biomass into gas) and liquefaction (creating liquids from solids and gases), one can create various fuels and energies from coal and other carbonaceous materials.
