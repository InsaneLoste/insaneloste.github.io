<p>The user can effectively move, act and attack even when late at doing something. For example, if their attack is too late to hit an opponent before they dodge, or if they are too late dodge or block an attack before it hits them, they still hit their opponent or dodge or block an attack regardless. This can be applied in many other situations.
