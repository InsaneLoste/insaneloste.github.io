<p>Users, either innately or through training, are masters of wielding <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Khakkhara" title="wikipedia:Khakkhara">khakkhara</a>, staffs topped with metal rings traditionally carried by Buddhist monks, particularly in the East Asian tradition. They are experts at fighting with a khakkhara, dealing blunt attacks in rapid succession, swinging and performing moves and techniques with supreme beauty and skill. Outside of combat, users can also utilize lhakkhara for many other purposes like festivals and celebrations, as it was adapted from a noisemaker (to announce a monk's presence or frighten away animals) to a rhythmic instrument during chanting and sutra recitations. They might also possess great knowledge in it beyond that of the majority of humans.
