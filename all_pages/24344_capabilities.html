<p>User is unnaturally/supernaturally skilled in the art of parkour, allowing them to overcome obstacles, such as walls and gaps with ease. Additionally, this allows one to do parkour/run on/jump on any surface, whether fragile, non-level, rough, slippery, vertical, horizontal, diagonal, moving, accelerating, rotating, in the air, narrow, small, shaking and so on. Environments of almost any kind are easily maneuverable for the user, and they will be able to do parkour feats no one else can. Obstacles are no problem for the user. They can do parkour feats at speeds that would be dangerous for people to do parkour feats in.
