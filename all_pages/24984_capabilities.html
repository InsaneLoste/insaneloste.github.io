<p>The user can generate telekinetic <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Force_Field_Generation" title="Force Field Generation">fields</a> or <a href="/wiki/Tractor_Beam_Emission" title="Tractor Beam Emission">beams</a> that can surround a target and permit the user to move, manipulate and otherwise interact with them. Because the user is generating constructs to interact with the subject and not the object itself, users are confined to lesser or limited telekinesis or telekinetic aura applications.
