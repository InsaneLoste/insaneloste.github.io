<p>User can create, shape and manipulate lightning of a primordial nature. As opposed to regular Lightning Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiment of lightning. As such, they can cause natural lightning-based effects such as thunderstorms, coronal discharge, or St. Elmo's Fire to manifest. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Lightning Manipulation as lightning is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunities &amp; resistances to electrical abilities.
