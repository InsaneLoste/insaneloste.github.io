<p>Users' hearing is pushed to the highest limits of human perfection. Individuals with this ability are capable of hearing small sounds along with listening in on approaching or incoming movements, and can easily hear sound clearly through a thick bricked wall, and even from a mile away in complete silence. They can also hear a watch ticking from over 100ft away and their hearing range is 10Hz-40kHz.
