<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cold" title="wikipedia:Cold">cold</a> by reducing the kinetic energy of atoms and thus making things colder, ranging from subjective feeling of cool to <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Absolute_zero" title="wikipedia:Absolute zero">absolute zero</a>. A very possible side-effect of this power is the ability to induce illnesses that are directly cold based (for example <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hypothermia" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Hypothermia</a>). Bone and other limbs as well, can become brittle and weaken under extreme cold, to the point that they can shatter without pain due to loss of feeling and color in the affected area <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frostbite" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">(Frostbite)</a>.
