<p>User can deny the effects of destiny/fate, including their own recorded fate. This allows them to shrug off the effects of their own predetermined existence, such if they were fated to die or disappear after accomplishing a certain mission or objective or possibly be separated and made to forget a loved one, they would instead be able to ignore that and live longer than they should or remember someone they were supposed to have forgotten.
