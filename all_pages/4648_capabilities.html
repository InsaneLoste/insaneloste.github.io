<p>User can manipulate the intensity/saturation of both visible and non-visible color, allowing them to augment/enhance, dilute, fade, remove, and even alter its clarity/quality as well. They can do things such as enhancing the wavelength of color to lethal levels, altering it so appears to be a different color, cause blindness by magnifying the color of the sky, make normal colors invisible or augment normally non-visible colors to visibility, and more.
