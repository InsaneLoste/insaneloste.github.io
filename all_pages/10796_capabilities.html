<p>User can create, shape and manipulate the geoelectric energy, the electrical energy generated by the planet, typically in the form of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/telluric_current" title="wikipedia:telluric current">telluric currents</a>, the electric currents that run underneath the planet’s surface or throughout the oceans. These currents are usually generated by alterations in the planet’s magnetic field (geomagnetic) but can originate from human activity (man-made networks like power grids). They flow under the planet’s layers towards areas that receive the most sunlight (equatorial areas on the day side and polar areas on the night side).
