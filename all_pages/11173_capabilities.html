<p>The user possesses an increased effectiveness against specific types of entities, objects, elements, terrains, etc., causing anything that user does against that thing to be, in a general or specific way, greatly more effective than against any other type of thing. In practice this means that against that thing the user: may deal more damage, have effects they apply last longer, find its defences are less effective, may bypass its defences altogether, have things work more easily, may spend less resources, etc.
