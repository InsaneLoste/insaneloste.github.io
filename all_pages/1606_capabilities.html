<p>User is made up of or can transform their body completely into apocalyptic force. Users' transformed form can be anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of apocalyptic force, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other. The user is the embodiment of the apocalyptic force that which will bring the destruction of everything, thus the user has infinte control over the end itself and everything that which will lead to the destruction by apocalyptic force.
