<p>The users are or can transform into a Grim Reaper, which is another form of the <a href="/wiki/Death_Embodiment" title="Death Embodiment">personification of Death</a>. Death is frequently imagined as a personified force. In some mythologies, a character is known as the Grim Reaper, who, after Death, collects a person's soul. These types of beings are a form of <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Psychopomp" title="Archetype:Psychopomp">psychopomp</a>, which means the 'guide of souls' are creatures, spirits, angels, demons, or deities in many religions whose responsibility is to escort newly deceased souls from Earth to the afterlife. Their role is not to <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Judge_of_the_Dead" title="Archetype:Judge of the Dead">judge the deceased</a> but to guide them. However, unlike many Psychopomps grim reapers have been able to possess the touch of death, while still limited to the mandate of a mortal's lifespan, unable to take them before their time in most circumstances. Grim reapers have been depicted in different times and cultures as anthropomorphic entities, horses, deer, dogs, whip-poor-wills, ravens, crows, vultures, owls, sparrows and cuckoos; these users have the powers and responsibilities related to Death. Grim Reapers are seen as cloaked skeletal winged figures with scythes or sickles claiming the deceased's souls. Who takes them to their respected afterlives; however, this is not always the case, and they have been seen in various forms throughout history, even appearing as angels, demons, spirits, as well as humanoid entities.
