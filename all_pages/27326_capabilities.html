<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into an Wechuge, a cannibalistic monster from North American folklore that shares many similarities to the Wendigo and the Atshen, the main difference being that Wechuge are more powerful since they are born from the cursed souls of humans who have engaged in severe cultural taboos and become "too strong" - allowing ancient spirits of giant animals to possess them and transform them into large monsters made of ice that hunger for human flesh.
