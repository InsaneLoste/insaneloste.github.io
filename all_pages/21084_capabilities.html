<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into reanimated inanimate objects which grants several abilities depending on the object the user takes form in. Usually, as a reanimated object, the user is wrecked, damaged beyond repair, unable to function any more or in pieces, yet like a zombie, can still act as if it were alive. The object they mimic can be anything, but it is usually in the form of vehicles, robots and machines, toys and puppets, statues and so on.
