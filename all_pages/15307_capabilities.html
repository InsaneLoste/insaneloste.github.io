<p>The user is able to apply incredible force to their fists, enabling them to throw a superhuman punch. While this term has been used to describe many supernatural punches, the true megaton punch is packed with <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/TNT_equivalent#Kiloton_and_megaton" title="wikipedia:TNT equivalent">4.18 petajoules of energy</a>.  If delivered as an upper-cut to the jaw of an indestructible 200 lbs human, the massive kinetic energy dump would accelerate the target to over 6,000 km/s, exceeding <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Escape_velocity" title="wikipedia:Escape velocity">escape velocity</a> and launching them on a direction permanently away from earth.  Most targets, however, are not indestructible and they will giveway or cease to exist before the full power of the punch is delivered. That megaton uppercut delivered to a typical 200 lbs human would result in massive spinal damage, complete obliteration of the head, and still launch the body a considerable distance. The effect of a megaton punch is comparable to a directed nuclear explosion or a supernatural cannon. Users can punch through battle tank armor, smash down powerful fortress walls, and leave massive craters in the earth.
