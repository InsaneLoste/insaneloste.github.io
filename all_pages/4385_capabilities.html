<p>The user can regress civilizations to past states, including a civilization's culture, society, technology, sciences, economy, transport, communications, tools, weapons, etc. With this power, starting with a civilization's current state, one could, if it was currently a modern civilization, regress it to stone age civilization, or even something in between. Technology, economics, all forms of transport, science, society and such would all be devolved as if they time traveled to the past or rewind itself back in time.
