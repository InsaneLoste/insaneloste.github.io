<p>The user can mimic properties of a creature's physiology through supernatural means. Alternatively the userâ€™s genetic structure can alter itself to become identical to a biological creature upon contact. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Shapeshifting" title="Shapeshifting">Shapeshifting</a> and <a href="/wiki/DNA_Replication" title="DNA Replication">DNA Replication</a>, the user does not necessarily take on the appearance of the target but rather select parts of their physiological make up.
