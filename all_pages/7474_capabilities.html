<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Effigy" title="wikipedia:Effigy">effigies</a>, specially-constructed figures meant to imitate or represent certain individuals. They can be made of any material (e.g., clay, cloth, straw, wax, wood) using different types of practices like carving, molding, sewing and/or weaving and can be simple or ornate according to the craftsmanâ€™s design. Whatever the method, the figure will be used to represent a target of interest. For traditional and religious practices, effigies are often crafted and destroyed to mark specific events or occurrences, such as changes in the seasons. In the political sphere, effigies have been used as derisive models of people who inspire contempt and hatred. They are mocked, beaten and even set ablaze as symbolic attacks on despised individuals. In ritual and mystical contexts, they are often used as conduits for channeling supernatural power to affect targets. They can be used to heal, manipulate or even harm those being represented.
