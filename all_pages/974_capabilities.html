<p>The user either is or can transform into an Alpha Fairy, the most powerful form of fairy. Unlike lesser fairies,Â the alpha fairy possesses inherent skill in certain abilities. Alpha fairies are known to have a certain resistance against or complete immunity to many weaknesses of their people; on top of that, even if they die, they are powerful enough to be reborn after a specific time period has passed. Furthermore, depending on the world that the user comes from, they may have a demonic or holy nature, thus granting them access to even more powerful abilities - fairies in Irish Catholic Folk tales are an example of this, however this would not be present in the original polytheistic version of the Fae.
