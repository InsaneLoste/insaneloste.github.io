<ul><li>Must be able to hit the specific nerve-clusters/pressure points, so anything that prevents this (armor, thick enough skin/fat, unusual nervous system) reduces or nullifies this power's effectiveness.</li>
<li>May be less effective against those with an altered/different nervous system since they possess different nerve clusters/pressure points than the ones the user knows about.</li>
<li>Useless against nervless enemies (robots, ghosts, etc)</li></ul>
