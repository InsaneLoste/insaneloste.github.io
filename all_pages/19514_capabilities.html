<p>A user can remotely transfer their consciousness into another body (usually servants or people they are attuned with), overriding their mind and possibly reshaping the possessed body as they see fit, often in their own image. They may do it to assume direct control of their troops on the battlefield or personally communicate through them regarding important matters. They may also do it to instantly reach a faraway destination while retaining their full power or shrug off lethal damage and even death via instant remote possession.
