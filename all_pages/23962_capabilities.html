<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a Strife Deity, a deity associated with Strife, Discord, Conflict, Arguments, Feuds, Fighting, Disputes, Debates, Contention and all their aspects. This grants them absolute knowledge and power over them, their concepts and principles.Â They are often worshiped by debaters, quarrelers, and those looking for a fight, be it verbal or physical. More than likely, factions of worshipers would fight amongst themselves to curry the user's favor, as the conflict and disputes would empower the user. Strife Deities weren't a common feature of worship in polytheistic religions but were important among ancient and current civilizations.
