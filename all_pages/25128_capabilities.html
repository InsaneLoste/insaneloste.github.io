<p>The user can accelerate or decelerate the flow of time of an object's motion but not the object itself meaning that it is at an abnormal speed yet its non-locomotive functions such as thinking or computing are at normal speed, e.g. the user could accelerate a guided missile's temporal motion so it flies faster but its computer acts at a normal speed, preventing it from hitting its target.
