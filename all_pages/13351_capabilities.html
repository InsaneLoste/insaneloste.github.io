<p>The user can use <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jet_propulsion" title="wikipedia:Jet propulsion">jet propulsion</a>, which is motion produced by passing a jet of matter or energy in the opposite direction to the direction of motion. By conservation of momentum, the moving body is propelled in the opposite direction to the jet. The jet can be a continuous stream or, especially when used by animals, pulsating.
