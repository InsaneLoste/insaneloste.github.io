<p>The user can manipulate their internal and external entropic forces. Entropy is the thermodynamic measurement of stability/instability within a system of any kind. It can also represent heat energy as both are intertwined in the behavior of particles. The same can be said with internal energy as it is the same energy that drives entropy. By harnessing their entropic forces, the user can manipulate energy, matter, influence the state of things, and for any purpose one can think of as all things require stability on some level.
