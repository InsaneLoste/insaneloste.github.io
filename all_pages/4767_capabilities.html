<p>The user can take on a form and appearance which allows them to easily interact with members of different groups. This form is designed for individuals whose true forms, sizes, etc. are too extreme to fit in with those groups which cannot handle it, allowing them to hide their true forms, traits and appearances to avoid detection and socialize with others without drawing too much attention while possibly still having access to their more advanced powers and abilities.
