<p>User can perform aerobatic stunts while moving in space, including doing regular acrobatics, turns, loops, corkscrews, barrel rolling, spins, move upside down or backwards, etc. Due to the lack of gravity and how Newton's three laws of motion are in space, this would normally be difficult, but not with this power.
