<p>The user either is or can transform into an superior genie, a most powerful form of genie. Unlike lesser genie, the superior genie possesses greater skill and/or power in certain abilities. Superior genies are known to have a certain resistance against or complete immunity to many weaknesses of their people; on top of that, even if they die, they are powerful enough to be reborn after a specific time period has passed. Furthermore, depending on the world that the user comes from, they may have a demonic or holy nature, thus granting them access to even more powerful abilities.
