<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetism" title="wikipedia:Magnetism">magnetism</a> and <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnetic_field" title="wikipedia:Magnetic field">magnetic fields</a>, an attractive and repulsive phenomenon produced by the movement of electrical charges. Magnetic fields are regions surrounding a magnet, conductor carrying electric currents, streams of charged particles, or naturally found minerals. Magnetism performs a prominent role in electromagnetism. Magnetism is commonly demonstrated with ferromagnetic materials; matter that forms magnets or objects that are attracted to magnets. The most everyday types of metals attracted or influenced by magnetic fields are iron, cobalt, nickel, and other alloys. These metals are usually discovered on the Earth (and other locations in the universe), artificially created, and used for automobiles, agriculture, and metropolitan projects. Nearly every material that humanity is using is composed of or possesses a fraction of these elements. Not everything is attracted to magnetic fields, for example, diamagnetism. Property exhibited by substances with a negative magnetic susceptibility, producing a magnetic field in a direction opposite to the applied magnetic field. In short, diamagnetism is repulsive, commonly found in most organic compounds, water, wood, etc. To be distinguished from metal manipulation, magnetism manipulation cannot manipulate all forms of metallic matter, only elements influenced by magnetic fields. Due to magnetism playing a massive role in everyday operations from a microscopic to a universal level, users can control naturally generated, artificially created, and magnetic forces around everything. Due to the versatility, flexibility, and strength magnetism manipulation could achieve, users can manipulate every magnetic material found in matter.
