<p>Users of this ability are either a member of the Donestre or can mimic the traits of such. The Donestre are monsters found in medieval European folklore who were believed to inhabit far off lands. They resembled humans with the heads of lions and would welcome strangers to their land, bestow upon them many gifts and then brutally devour them, leaving behind only the head, which the Donestre would then mourn over.
