<p>The user is able to move freely and easily in any mean of warping through time, timelines. This may depend on the universe the user is in, but if there are particles or radiation the user encounters while going through portals, teleportation, etc., they cannot be slowed by them. The user also does not get lost easily, and they cannot get trapped between timelines or points in time. The user can also change paths to change destinations of where they are time traveling to, no matter where the tunnel or other means of travel is supposed to lead.
