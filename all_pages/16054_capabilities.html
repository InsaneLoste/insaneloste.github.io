<p>The user has a great skill in <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moshing" title="wikipedia:Moshing">moshing</a>, an extreme style of dancing in which participants push or slam into each other, typically performed to "aggressive" live music such as heavy metal and punk rock. To the untrained eye, a mosh pit looks like a bunch of morons running into and fighting one another. Its purpose, however, is not to injure, but rather to release frustrations and celebrate music. It also includes crowd surfing, headbanging and pogo-ing (jumping up and down in place).
