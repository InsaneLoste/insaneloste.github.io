<p>The user is able to manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meridian_(Chinese_medicine)" title="wikipedia:Meridian (Chinese medicine)">meridian system</a>, the bodily network through which one’s life energy (aura-based, chi-based, soul-based) flows. According to traditional Chinese medicine, the system permeates the entire body, transporting the life energy just as one’s vascular system transports blood and other bodily fluids. The complexity of the pathways creates the balanced nature of the body’s operations as well as emotional states. The energy flows to specific organs and extremities, allowing for their processes. It is connected to specialized nodes (<a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure_point" title="wikipedia:Pressure point">pressure points</a>), through which it can potentially be released. By controlling the meridians, one can manipulate both physiological energy flow and the functionality of the body to enhance, diminish and/or alter various physical capabilities, even to the point of granting oneself or another superhuman capabilities.
