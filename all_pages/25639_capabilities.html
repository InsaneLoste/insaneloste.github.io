<p>The user can control a projectile's trajectory path once it is fired or thrown, whether it be a bullet, laser beam, boomerang, knife/dagger, etc. This allows the projectile to curve around barriers and obstacles to reach targets, attack at unsuspecting angles and blind spots, confuse opponents as it keeps moving around before making the unexpected strike, and have it gain momentum and piercing power by flying around.
