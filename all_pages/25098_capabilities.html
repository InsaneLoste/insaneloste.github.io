<p>The user has a fine-tuned sense of precise time (current time, and the passage of time, personally, objectively and locally), some users can discern a subjectâ€™s age, as well as the alteration of, or travel through, time (including where and when to). Some users can determine the exact time an event has taken place or will take place, or how long it took or will take (as long as he knows the event has happened or will happen).
