<p>The user can write or re-write the rules of logic which apply to reality or an individual. They essentially dictate what is and what is not logical and can alter reality or another to make it so they would be more in tune with their rules of logic. With every law of logic the user mandates, reality alters itself to fit in with those laws. The user can also change the nature of another individual or themselves to seem more "logical".
