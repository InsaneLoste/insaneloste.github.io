<p>Users can <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Teleportation" title="wikipedia:Teleportation">teleport</a>; moving instantaneously from one location to another without physically occupying the space in between or transfer matter (beings/objects, including themselves) or energy from one point to another without traversing the physical space between them. This can be achieved by various means, including causing the atoms/molecules to travel at light-speed, warping the space, or use quantum superposition, in which the user teleports by spatially rearranging the subatomic contents of a system.
