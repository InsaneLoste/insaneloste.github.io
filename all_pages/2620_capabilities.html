<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binding_energy" title="wikipedia:Binding energy">binding energy</a>, the energy required to break a system down into its constituent parts. The sum of a system’s separate parts has more potential energy than a bound system, so a bound system is more stable. The more tightly bound the system, the greater the amount of energy to disassemble it. It can take the form of gravitational (the energy needed to pull apart bodies held together by gravity), bond energy (the energy needed to pull apart molecular bonds) or nuclear (the energy needed to disassemble an atom’s nucleus).
