<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Nure Onago or are one. Nure Onago are ghostly yokai that take the form of young woman who are constantly dripping in swamp water, often with dead leaves and other debris stuck all over their otherwise naked bodies. They are constantly surrounded by a foul smell of mildew and rot; in addition, their very presence causes rain and water to collect around them.
