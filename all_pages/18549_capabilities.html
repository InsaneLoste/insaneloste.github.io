<p>The user can manipulate the g-forces acting on the userâ€™s body alone. With this, the user can make it, so they feel less g-forces, or negative g-forces instead of positive ones, or transverse g-forces, too. They might even use this to feel lighter or heavier with acceleration or g-forces, even if they are not accelerating.
