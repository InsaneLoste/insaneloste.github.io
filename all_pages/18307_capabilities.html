<p>Users of this skill are considered the ultimate thieves, able to steal anything and everything (concepts, landmarks, natural elements/forces, intangible objects, physics, laws, themselves, etc.), they are able to not only hide in shadows but even in plain sight, they can slip into spaces that should be physically impossible to fit/slip into, and they can even steal without even having to be present at a location.
