<li>Certain things may prevent reloading.</li>
<li>Time can only be reloaded on the saved point, not a second sooner or later.</li>
<li>May have mixed memories from reloads.</li>
<li>Users of <a href="/wiki/Spatial-Temporal_Lock" title="Spatial-Temporal Lock">Spatial-Temporal Lock</a>, <a href="/wiki/Omnilock" title="Omnilock">Omnilock</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Temporal_Protection" title="Temporal Protection">Temporal Protection</a> will know time was reset but may not stop the user.</li>
<li>In some cases, this could cause a <a href="/wiki/Butterfly_Effect" title="Butterfly Effect">Butterfly Effect</a> even if the user stays on roughly the same timeline.</li>
<li>Users may not be able to change the future because of <a href="/wiki/Destiny_Assignment" title="Destiny Assignment">Destiny Assignment</a> and/or <a href="/wiki/Destiny_Chosen" title="Destiny Chosen">Destiny Chosen</a>.</li>
<li>Users cannot stop an <a href="/wiki/Inevitable_Event_Creation" title="Inevitable Event Creation">Inevitable Event</a>.</li>
<li>Pointless to use against users of <a href="/wiki/Temporal_Erasure" title="Temporal Erasure">Temporal Erasure</a> as they can permanently erase all points in time that were saved.</li>
<li>User may not be able to control or change the save point.</li>
<li>Reload may only take effect if the user performs a certain action, such as dying or falling asleep.</li>
<li>If the user saved in a situation where they would inevitably die and would be unable to escape it would result in a infinite death loop. Ex. reloading to a point such as falling straight into lava always leading to inevitable death. (This may not apply to some users who are able to wipe out there own save points or return to previous ones)</li>
<li>This ability may be completely useless for those who doesn't have any combat experiences/skills or any other superpowers for them to fight, and would only be efficient for information collecting, plotting plans, and deceiving/manipulating others.
<ul><li>However, when reloading to the save point, the user might need to remember the plan or risk foiling it or revealing information to the unintended recipient.</li></ul></li>
<li>The user isn't immune or have any resistance to the effects of other supernatural powers and they are vulnerable towards things that can kill or injured a normal person. This means users with <a href="/wiki/Power_Erasure" title="Power Erasure">Power Erasure</a>, <a href="/wiki/Power_Negation" title="Power Negation">Power Nullification</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Power_Absorption" title="Power Absorption">Power Absorption</a> can still affect the user's ability.</li>
<li>The user's <a href="/wiki/Will_Breaking" title="Will Breaking">will can easily be broke by others</a>, while their body and previous conditions may reset, but they usually retain their memories, goals, traumas, and general state of mind.
<ul><li>However, if the body sustains any injuries or diseases before the save point is active, than the body "remembers" the said terminal conditions, so when reloading to the save point the injuries/diseases might be temporarily healed, reduced, or potentially get worse.</li></ul></li>
<li>Any user that can warp reality like <a href="/wiki/Reality_Warping" title="Reality Warping">Reality Warping</a> or <a href="/wiki/Nigh-Omnipotence" title="Nigh-Omnipotence">Nigh-Omnipotence</a>/<a href="/wiki/Omnipotence" title="Omnipotence">Omnipotence</a> may/can undo or be unaffected by a temporal reload or just destroy the power all together.</li>
<li>In some cases, people inside the reload may gain a sense of déjà vu, allowing them to remember events from the reload.</li>
<li>Reloading to the save point undoes any progress the user has made to achieve victory, so they have to carefully coordinate and remember every step from their previous encounters.</li>
<li>Even if the user can go back beyond the saved point or came up with a strategy, there might be some situations that may be unwinnable.</li>
<li>If someone is aware of the user's power, like if they possess <a href="/wiki/Precognition" title="Precognition">Precognition</a>, they can plan ahead to incapacitate or capture the user to prevent them reloading back.</li></ul>
