<p>The user can enchant any object (weapons, jewelry, furniture, etc.) to be used by only those who are <a href="/wiki/Destiny_Chosen" title="Destiny Chosen">destined to do so</a>. Those not chosen/destined can not use the object or it's powers or even pick it up at all due to the enchantment, even if the person in question has <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enhanced_Strength" title="Enhanced Strength">Enhanced Strength</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Supernatural_Strength" title="Supernatural Strength">Supernatural Strength</a>, and may even be rejected by merely touching it.
