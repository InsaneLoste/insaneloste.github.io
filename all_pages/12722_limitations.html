<ul><li>Some users <i>cannot</i> manipulate their own inertia.</li>
<li>Some users can <i>only</i> manipulate their own inertia.</li>
<li>Some users can only manipulate inertia one way or the other (to resist motion, or resist rest).</li>
<li>If the user has no control over the ability, the following can happen:
<ul><li>User may cause the opposite inertial change than desired (increasing or decreasing inertia, when one intends to do the opposite).</li>
<li>Inertia may change too much (which can damage the object whose inertia is being altered).</li></ul></li>
<li>Users may have more difficulty manipulating the inertia of larger objects.</li>
<li>May cause unintended consequences to complex machines that rely on moving parts and their corresponding inertia to function. Same goes true for living organisms who depend on many different forms of moving cells, organs, fluids, etc. to continue functioning.</li>
<li>Objects with inertia that is too small may be hard to keep in motion, and may require constant force.</li>
<li>Objects with inertia that is too big may be hard to move or stop without the proper strength.</li></ul>
