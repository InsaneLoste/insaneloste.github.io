<ul><li>Tend to collapse entities, thus effects are usually one-sided. Can be destructive as other powers are often required to reverse the operation.</li>
<li>An unskilled user will often find a black hole is left in their wake.</li>
<li>Requires an extensive understand of the concepts involved in the collapse to decided accurately what to collapse, as due to the ambiguous nature of concepts, many unintended side effects can occur when the collapse is brought out carelessly (e.g. via "damage suffered"/0 via "healing himself", a person will be impervious to all kinds of damage, this include beneficial things such as blood transfusion (unless it can be done without a needle)</li>
<li>Although extremely capable, it cannot match the power of <a href="/wiki/Omnipotence" title="Omnipotence">Omnipotence</a> or <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Nigh_Omnipotence" title="Nigh Omnipotence">Nigh Omnipotence</a></li>
<li>Entities who form the only example of their respective categories are immune to collapse with regard to that category; collapsing attempt with regard to another category by exploiting that fact that entities can belong to multiple categories, these aforementioned entities can be resistant to that depending on the Verse requirements</li>
<li>The scrambling ability of this power on physical target (instead of just one aspect of it such as its location) will make the target susceptible to <a href="/wiki/Uncertainty_Manipulation" title="Uncertainty Manipulation">Uncertainty Manipulation</a>, since its original identity or nature has been lost and can be anything possible, including its original self, thus uncertain.</li>
<li>Users of <a href="/wiki/Numerical_Transcendence" title="Numerical Transcendence">Numerical Transcendence</a> are immune.</li></ul>
