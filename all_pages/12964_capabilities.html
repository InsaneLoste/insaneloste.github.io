<p>The user can induce innocence onto anyone, whether pure innocence or innocence of a crime. When the innocence is induced, the responsibility for anything like a crime is shifted to another person, or makes it so that the victim or object destroyed or damaged did it to themselves. Either way, it makes it so that the user is not responsible for what happened.
