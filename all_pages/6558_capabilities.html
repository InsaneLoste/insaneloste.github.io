<p>User can create, shape and manipulate dimensional elements, including points in space, lines, 2D planes and 3D volumes of things, etc. They can effectively reshape and resize objects, warp them in different ways, and maybe what is in them, such as pictures and other art. They can manipulate how planes, points, lines and volumes are connected, reconnecting points and determining where lines lead.
