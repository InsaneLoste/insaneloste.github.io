<p>User can adapt to having their body parts or bodily functions rearranged or scrambled. For example, if the user's brain is altered so that they jump instead of running when they try to think about doing a run, the user can adapt to that. The user can also adapt to having, for example, their arms relocated to be on their backside instead of on the upper side of their body.
