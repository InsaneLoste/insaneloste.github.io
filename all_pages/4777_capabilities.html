<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a Compassion Deity, a god/goddess who represents and is associated with compassion, caring, kindness, tenderness, mercy, tolerance, pity, forgiveness, gratitude and charity, and all their aspects. This grants them absolute knowledge and power over them, their concepts, and principles.
