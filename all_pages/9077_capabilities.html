<p>Users possess a soul that cannot be destroyed or take any form of damage, in addition to always existing, rendering them completely immune to all manner of <a href="/wiki/Soul_Manipulation" title="Soul Manipulation">spiritual alteration</a> or <a href="/wiki/Soul_Destruction" title="Soul Destruction">destruction</a> including their absolute versions.
