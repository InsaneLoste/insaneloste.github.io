<p>Users of this ability can take on the traits of a Moddey Dhoo (or are one), the Moddey Dhoo is a type of ghostly Black Dog found in Manx folklore and while often frightening is a neutral entity, in contrast to the usually malevolent aspects found in Black Dogs across other folklore - the Moddey Dhoo is often envisioned as very large with disturbing eyes, while they normally simply haunt the land they can sometimes attack people who are disrespectful or ignorant (such as drunkards).
