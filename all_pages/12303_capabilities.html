<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iaijutsu" title="wikipedia:iaijutsu">iaijutsu</a>/<a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/iaido" title="wikipedia:iaido">iaido</a>, a combative quick-draw sword technique. Iaijutsu consists of four main components: the smooth, controlled movements of drawing the sword from its scabbard (or saya), striking or cutting an opponent, shaking blood from the blade, and replacing the sword in the scabbard. Masters of iaijutsu are typically able to draw, cut, and sheathe their blade faster than the eye can see, making it seem like they didn't perform any cutting motions in the first place.
