<p>The user can induce a combination of actual existence and nonexistence into something, Existent or nonexistent and perceivable by one or more of the five senses. For example, it could make a chair that does not exist partially be existent in the middle of a hallway, and the user would not see or detect the chair in any way, other than by touch, so they would trip over it as they go along but can't detect its presence otherwise. They cannot detect it with sight, hearing, or any other sense, even if it is outside the normal five senses, for it only partially exists, though it can also be seen but not perceivable and detectable by the other senses.
