<p>The user is a temporal anomaly, born into the wrong time (either years before he/she should have been, or years after), or into the wrong timeline altogether, as though it is his/her proper place. As such, they will move faster (or slower) than normal, age faster (or slower) and are prone to intuitive feelings or perhaps random knowledge (even visions) about their correct time period. Likewise, the user is resistant (if not entirely immune) to temporal abilities.
