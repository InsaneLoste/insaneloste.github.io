<p>Users have the ability to maneuver, task and fight at full force and motion despite being too close to the opponent or object, like a few centimeters or inches away, where normally the user would have to build up speed and force from a far distance to be effective. The user can wall run while close to a wall or they can punch with their fist inches away from their opponent at full force.
