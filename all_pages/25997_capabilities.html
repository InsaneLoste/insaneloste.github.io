<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into <a class="external text" href="http://yokai.com/tsuraraonna/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Tsurara-Onna</a>, beautiful humanoid female yokai that are created from the loneliness of single men during winter time. Tsurara-Onna are believed to be a personification of Ice, snow, freezing cold, frost, cold weather and winter having absolute control over those phenomen. When a man gazes longingly at a strong, beautiful icicle hanging from a roof and reflects upon his loneliness, a Tsurara-Onna may appear shortly afterwards.  Their appearances and behavior are similar to Yuki-Onna.  When snow and icicles melt, the Tsurara-Onna will disappear as well, leaving the man lonely once again.
