<p>User is or can transform their body completely into swamp, combining the powers of earth, water and plant-life into one. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of swamp, in which case, it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
