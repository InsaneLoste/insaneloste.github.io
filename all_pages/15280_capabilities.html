<p>Users are extremely knowledgeable in the use of medical torture. These are tortures that utilize medical knowledge and science for nefarious and harmful purposes, in direct conflict with the oath many medical practitioners must make when they become part of the medical world. As such, medical torture (alongside most other forms of torture) has long been outlawed in many settings due to the extreme pain and suffering it can inflict on victims as well as the general unreliable nature of torture (with truth serums and similar techniques being shown to be ineffective in obtaining accurate information).
