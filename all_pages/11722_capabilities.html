<p>The user is a heavyworlder, a creature adjusted to high-gravity environments (such as super earths, mini-neptunes, gas giants, etc...). In response to the intense gravity impacting their entire body and the adaptation period, their physical body is enhanced (stronger bones/muscles, increased maneuverability, etc...) depending on the gravitational pressure due to evolving to withstand such pressure. This also allows users to thrive in higher-gravitational worlds that weak life cannot survive on.
