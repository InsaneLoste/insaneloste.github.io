Metaphysics includes science and goes beyond it to encompass all aspects and dimensions of existence experienced as "reality". In the conscious evolution, metaphysics has taken its place as one of the most comprehensive and most effective means of gaining knowledge and understanding about the true nature of the physical universe.
