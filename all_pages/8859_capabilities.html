<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Era" title="wikipedia:Era">eras</a>, long periods of time that denote important parts of history. This allows them to decide how long they are, how they start, and even how they end. Since eras make up the entire basis of history, the user has total control of every event, moment, and period of time in the universe.
