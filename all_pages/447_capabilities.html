<p>User becomes stronger, faster, smarter, more durable, etc. from action/activities either voluntary or involuntary (ie blinking, breathing, eating, moving/traveling, touching, talking, sneezing, creating/building, drawing, reading, etc; basically any action verb) of oneself and/or others, possibly unlocking abilities related to the affinity and enhancing their existing powers. Even if the user constantly is doing one action, the user will continuously be empowered because of continuously doing that one single action. The level and rate of the power boost depends on the user in question. Some users may be able to draw sustenance from activity or even stop or slow aging.
