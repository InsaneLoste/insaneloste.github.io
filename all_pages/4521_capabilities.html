<p>Users of this power can take on the powers of the Clurichaun (or are one) - this is the drunken, mischief-prone cousin to the Leprechaun and while similar to the legendary sprite they tend to be more goblin-like and haunt wine cellars, often they will torment the owners of these cellars with poltergeist-like activities but can also guard the cellars and were known to be prolific pranksters as well as brutish, capable of beating humans black and blue if they felt the need, with thieves seeming to attract the most wrath from the spirit.
