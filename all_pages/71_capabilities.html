<p>The user possesses limitless accuracy, being able to react to and hit any/all targets, no matter how impossible/improbable/unlikely the odds are or fast it is. They can instantly react and zero-in on their target without even having to aim/look at or even be anywhere near their target; including making absolutely impossible hits/shots, perfect shots with their eyes closed or hands tied and/or even successfully hit homing targets and <a href="/wiki/Target_Lock_Disruption" title="Target Lock Disruption">disrupted</a>/<a href="/wiki/Attack_Ignoring" title="Attack Ignoring">ignored</a> targets. This places the user above virtually all other beings in the multiverse in terms of accuracy.
