<p>The user can restore and return lost internal organs (heart, brains, etc.) to those who have lost them by various means. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Creation" title="Creation">creation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Regrowth" title="Regrowth">regrowth</a>, the target's organs are not created from scratch or regrown, rather they're restored to the point as if they never lost them in the first place.
