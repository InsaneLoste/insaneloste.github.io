<p>The user is made up of or can transform their body completely into <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Seaweed" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">seaweed</a>. The users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of seaweed, in which case, it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
