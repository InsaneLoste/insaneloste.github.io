<p>The user is in a condition, state and quality of being that takes the <i>appearance/perception</i> of being free from any possible form of flaw or defect, but has certain limits/weaknesses that restrict their being and prevents them from attaining complete perfection, as they aren't <a href="/wiki/Perfection" title="Perfection">fundamentally perfect</a> to begin with. They may be faultless on specific fields with almost limitless abilities, but despite their perceived unlimited number of flawlessness, the users can only reach and develop to near-perfection or falsely mimic it. That being said, their vast array of abilities still make them a lot more powerful than many beings in their domain of existence.
