<p>The character is an alpha beastwere, the most powerful form of beastwere imaginable. Unlike most, the alpha beastwere will command legions of beastweres. Alpha Beastwere have less or even none of the weaknesses that normal beastweres have. They have heighten mental capabilities on par with, or even higher than humans. They also possess full sentience and may possess souls. They can also unleash their dominant inner animal for maximum power. They have all of a beast's and human's strength with none of their weaknesses. They have the best of both worlds.
