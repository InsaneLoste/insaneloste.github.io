<p>The user has the ability to move and act well when parts of the body are rotated. So when then upper body is rotated 90 degrees or 180 degrees from its normal position, or the leg's knee or hip are rotated about the same angles, the user can effectively still move despite the body parts being rotated, or even stuck in such positions. They can thus do acrobatics and movements that should be impossible.
