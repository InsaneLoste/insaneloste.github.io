<p>The user can create and project bolts of energy/matter and control the intensity/power of their projectiles. Generally, while the bolts aren't weak, they tend not to be powerful as a <a href="/wiki/Blast_Attacks" title="Blast Attacks">stronger</a> or <a href="/wiki/Beam_Emission" title="Beam Emission">more sustained</a> attack but tend to be far more likely to prevent unwanted damage due to their relatively smaller size and shorter duration. Aside from being precise and accurate, they can also be quicker and easier to launch and thus allow for multiple bolts to be fired either <a href="/wiki/Scatter_Shot" title="Scatter Shot">all at once</a> or <a href="/wiki/Bullet_Hell" title="Bullet Hell">rapidly in quick succession</a>. While they mostly appear as segmented projectiles, some bolts can appear as brief <a href="/wiki/Ray/Beam_Manipulation" title="Ray/Beam Manipulation">beams or arcs</a> of energy/matter while others can <a href="/wiki/Expanding_Bolts" title="Expanding Bolts">change in shape or size</a> depending on the userâ€™s control over them. These bolts could be used to <a href="/wiki/Incapacitation_Inducement" title="Incapacitation Inducement">incapacitate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Attraction_%26_Repulsion" title="Attraction &amp; Repulsion">repel</a>, <a href="/wiki/Burning" title="Burning">burn</a>, or even <a href="/wiki/Cutting" title="Cutting">penetrate</a>/<a href="/wiki/Impale" title="Impale">stab</a> their target, as well as potentially <a href="/wiki/Category:Inducement_Powers" title="Category:Inducement Powers">inducing</a> other <a href="/wiki/Effect_Generation" title="Effect Generation">effects</a>.
