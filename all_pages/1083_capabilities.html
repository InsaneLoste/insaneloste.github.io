<p>Users are an Amazon; a powerful race of all-female warriors in Greek mythology and classical antiquity. Amazons had what could be called "blessings" or "gifts," of divine empowerment that made an exotic form of human beings (sometimes known as a mythic human). They are all linked by being fantastical variants of humanity, thus having unique traits and powers. Being stronger, faster, more durable, etc., has certain advantages over normal human beings. The Amazon user could also have honed their skills in many fields like archery, equestrianism, hand-to-hand combat, swordsmanship, etc.
