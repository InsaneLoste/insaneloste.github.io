<p>Users embody melancholy, sadness, and sorrow. At the most fundamental level, users would possess key physical characteristics and/or personality traits related to the concept they're personifying, such as being discontent and moody no matter the circumstance, even when the situation doesn't cause sadness. Most users that embody melancholy would be able to become stronger and more powerful the more sadness they and perhaps others feel. Some might also be capable of inducing sadness into others (sometimes to the point of causing their death) or manipulate the emotion in general. Certain embodiments may be able to manifest sadness as a force or energy to accomplish supernatural feats, and more powerful embodiments are usually the source of all sadness in their universe.
