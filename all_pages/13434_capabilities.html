<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kabaddi" title="wikipedia:Kabaddi">kabaddi</a>, a sport played between two teams of seven players. The objective of the game is for a single player on offense, referred to as a "raider", to run into the opposing team's half of a court, touch out as many of their defenders as possible, and return to their own half of the court, all without being tackled by the defenders, and in a single breath.
