<p>User can manipulate postulates theories and hypotheses, things assumed without proof as being self-evident or generally accepted, especially when used as a basis for an argument or in scientific investigation. User can make a postulate or theory true or false, and they can affect reality, matter, energy and other things by manipulating the theory or postulate as if it were true, and make it so that it is reality if it wasn't before.
