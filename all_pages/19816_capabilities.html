This makes them a master of manipulation, pursuit, and capture. It includes sensing what will happen and how to adapt to it, what move a target will make, where they are headed, etc. effectively allowing them to manipulate the target and causing them to inevitably play right into the user's hands, as well as how to attack without giving away oneâ€™s presence, and how to preserve energy when attacking.
