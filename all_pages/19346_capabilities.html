<p>The user is immune to all forms of poisons/toxins/venom. This makes a perfect counter-ability to those with <a href="/wiki/Poison_Manipulation" title="Poison Manipulation">Poison Manipulation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Poison_Inducement" title="Poison Inducement">Poison Inducement</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Poison_Generation" title="Poison Generation">Poison Generation</a>. This also include all forms of <a href="/wiki/Venom_Secretion" title="Venom Secretion">Venom Secretion</a>. With complete protection from venom, the user could be bitten/stung by a toxic creature and merely sustain physical damage. Ingesting, inhaling or even drinking poisons/toxins/venom wouldn't harm the user, more-than-likely just leaving a bad taste.
