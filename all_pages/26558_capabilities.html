<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vacuum" title="wikipedia:Vacuum">vacuum</a>, the atmospheric region devoid of physical matter and energy. Since air molecules exist within what would be an otherwise empty space, the user can twist the region of vacuum to manipulate air, creating winds of varying levels including tornadoes and hurricanes, reject air to create vacuums and air blasts. This also grants the user a defense against (normal) <a href="/wiki/Category:Fire-Based_Abilities" title="Category:Fire-Based Abilities">fire</a> and <a href="/wiki/Category:Sound_Powers" title="Category:Sound Powers">sound</a>-based abilities, as both require atmospheric air as a medium to function.
