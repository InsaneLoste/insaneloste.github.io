<p>The user is simultaneously both lightweight and not lightweight, allowing them to have both no physical mass/weight and physical mass/weight at once. As such they can do things like walk on heavy switches and activating them or break through really hard floors because they have physical weight but they can also not knock things over or can carry things that weigh less than enough to be carried while affecting their surroundings.
