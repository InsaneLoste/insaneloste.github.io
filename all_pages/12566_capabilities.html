<p>The user can create, manipulate, and destroy imps, demonic entities of the infernal or magical planes; they control them to do their bidding like helping them during situations, use them against foes, use them to see locations and get information about a particular place, use them for battle and/or use them for spying on others. The controlled beasts may cultivate bonds with the user, thus creating friendships; users also may empathize or communicate with them.
