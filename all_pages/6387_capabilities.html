<p>The user can detect/be aware theyâ€™re being sensed through extrasensory, conceptual, etc, means. They may be aware of how they are being sensed, where their sensor is, and possibly who their sensor is. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Observation_Detection" title="Observation Detection">Observation Detection</a> in which the user can only detect when they are being <i>seen</i>, with Detection Awareness the user can sense when they are being detected by such powers as <a href="/wiki/Detection" title="Detection">Detection</a> and its variations.
