<p>The user can adapt to the defenses and immunities of others. This makes it so that when the user uses a power or attack on a target and it does not work at first, the attack or power becomes more powerful that it actually affects or harms the target the second time, or more than that if it takes more than one attack. This effectively overrides resistances, durability and immunities that may otherwise prevent the target from being affected or harmed.
