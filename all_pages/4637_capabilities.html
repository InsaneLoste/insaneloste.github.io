<p>The user can manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Color_charge" title="wikipedia:Color charge">color charge</a> of quarks and carried by gluons. A quark's color can take one of three values or charges: red, green, and blue. An antiquark can take one of three anticolors: called antired, antigreen, and antiblue. Simply put, in order for three quarks to couple to form, for example, a proton, their “colour” must add up/cancel out to form “white”.
