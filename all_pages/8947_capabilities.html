<p>The user has the power to manipulate the concept of dreams of oneself and others with supernatural properties that the normal variant would not be able to do. This involves controlling forces where one can affect things that regular dream manipulation could not, as well as go to and manipulate the dreams in worlds one normally could not (from the living world to the world of the dead or vice versa, spirit world, etc.), and go to and manipulate the dreams entities that would normally be immune (i.e., demons, angels, gods and spirits).
