<p>The user can distort the laws of physics, permitting the user to violate any physical law displaced in the universe. Everything that composes physics (matter, energy, space-time.), including its sub-properties, can be violated and distorted to a certain extent without reaching the manipulation level. The user can bend the laws of physics to walk on walls, increase one's momentum, kinetic energy, and power, and negate most physical forces. The difference between physics distortion and physics manipulation is physics manipulation allows the user to freely manipulate physical laws (matter, energy, space-time, etc.) to any degree, permitting them to generate, delete, negate, contort, or break any physical law that exists. The user is limited to only deforming existing physical laws to certain degrees.
