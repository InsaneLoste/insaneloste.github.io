<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a kurote or are one. A kurote is a strange and perverted toilet-demon that lurks in toilets waiting for a victim to enter, where upon it will try to stroke their behind - why they do this is unknown, but it is likely done purely to shock and frighten, however they can be much more dangerous when provoked. For example, a samurai would experience firsthand the wrath of a kurote after he succeeded in cutting off the demon's hand one night after it tried to harass his wife. Within days, a priest arrived at his home and asked about a strange presence in the home, the samurai brought a box containing the severed hand of the demon only for the priest to transform into a nine-foot-tall monster and angrily grab the hand and flee. A few nights later, the same samurai would be ambushed by a large figure on a walk home. The creature trapped him in a bag and stole the sword he had used when attacking the kurote and tossed him aside while he was not troubled again by the kurote. It is a cautionary tale on the dangers even the most seemingly bizarre yokai can hide.
