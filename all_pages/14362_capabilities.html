<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Little_people_(mythology)" title="wikipedia:Little people (mythology)">little people</a>, small magical humanoid creature from the folklore of many cultures in human history, including Ireland, Greece, the Philippines, the Hawaiian Islands, New Zealand, Flores Island, Indonesia, and Native Americans. They are generally very human-like, with possibly few signs of supernatural such as animal features, resembling the local population both in appearance and behavior/culture. What truly separates/defines them is their size, which ranges from very short but in human range to small enough to ride insects.
