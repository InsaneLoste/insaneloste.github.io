<p>The user either is or can transform into a dinosaur that possesses superhuman powers and abilities far beyond those of regular dinosaurs. Such a dinosaur would be several times more powerful than a normal one, much like how a metahuman would be to a normal human. For instance, these dinosaurs can defend themselves much better and be able to defeat threats that regular dinosaurs wouldn't be capable of doing so on their own.
