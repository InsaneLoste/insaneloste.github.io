They are able to deal with extreme weather conditions (hurricanes, tidal waves, floods, etc.), along with the capacity to go without water or food and to use it more efficiently (including reduced need for sustenance), skin or body systems which better deal with heat (reducing its intake, tolerating it, or getting rid of it) and the cold of islands and coastal areas as well as the ever-present sand, and perhaps coloration close to the color of the a coastal/island environment.
