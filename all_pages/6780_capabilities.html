<p>The user is able to create and/or wield weapons with power over divine-demonic energy, a mixture of divine and demonic energy that either acts as two separate weapons wielded simultaneously, two opposing elements in a single weapon, or a manipulation of divine-demonic energy in and of themselves. This ability is not only specific to mystic weapons, but also technologically advanced weapons. The power of the weapons depends on what they were created for or what level of divine-demonic-based ability they possess.
