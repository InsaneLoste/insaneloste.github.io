<p>The user can perform actions, moves and attacks in a perfect and smooth way, allowing them to move/act their body or body parts in a perfect line or angle/curve or move completely still, and make zero jounces, jerks, bumps while doing it. This can also be used to make steady and precise changes in speed despite external forces and changes in one's environment. If attacked, the user will not react, and if they do, they will act or move in a way that looks perfect and smooth. The user's body motions are also unresisted, meaning the user can effectively defy inertia, friction, gravity, etc. They can perfectly move or act at high speeds, and even their accelerations or changes in what they are doing are perfect. They can be unaffected by outside forces, though they would still take damage from attacks. They can also move in dots and dashed lines separated from each other, like steps or jumps smoothly and perfectly.
