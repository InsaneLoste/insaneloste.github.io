<p>The user can manipulate their biology/biological nature. Their body, its aspects, and processes are capable of being enhanced, diminished, altered, and removed according to the needs and desires of the individual. This can range from altering aesthetic aspects (appearance, color, and height) to controlling internal processes (circulation, cellular activities, and hormonal effects) to changing biological needs (sleep, hunger, and healing requirements) to transforming species-based traits (DNA, evolution/devolution or adaptations). The user’s imagination may define the limits of one’s control.
