<p>The user is able to revive themselves upon death either instantly or after some time. The user still dies, so it would be inaccurate to call them <a href="/wiki/Immortality" title="Immortality">immortal</a>, but their death is ultimately meaningless as they will respawn.Â Generally, this happens by returning to life in a position near their death, though some users may re-manifest in a specific location.
