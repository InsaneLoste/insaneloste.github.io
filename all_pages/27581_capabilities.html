<p>The user can manipulate word-based mathematics, meaning that they can take two words, and the objects or substance associated with them, and merge or separate them (mainly merging) through adding or subtracting them (for example, fire + ice equals water). The user can effectively do this with any concept, object, energy, attack, power, etc. The user can also add to or take away things from a single word, making it so that they have more or less of something, possibly changing their identity.
