<p>User can cause any/all attacks to completely ignore them, this allows them to avoid damage not by defense but by causing any attack to bypass them as a viable target. Even attacks that are <a href="/wiki/Homing_Effect" title="Homing Effect">homing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Targeting" title="Targeting">locked on</a>, or even selective would completely ignore them as if they weren't even there.
