<p>Users are not limited to just the average range of enhanced seeing, they can see everything that goes on in the world, or even the entire galaxy, or maybe the entire universe. They can do more than just see everything that goes on, they can see the thoughts of anyone and everyone (not to be confused with <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">Telepathy</a>) and bypass time itself and can see the future and past.
