<p>Users can create, shape, and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice" title="wikipedia:Ice">ice</a>, water frozen into a solid state. As an elemental power, cryokinesis has a nigh-limitless number of uses, only limited by the user's imagination and their natural limits. Fundamentally, users would be able to generate ice through various means, such as lowering the temperature of the surrounding air until solid ice forms or by freezing nearby water sources. They could release and channel this ice in the form of ice beams that freeze whatever it comes into contact with, or extremely rigid and durable ice walls and domes that can be used offensively and defensively. There's also the capacity to use ice in order to freeze one's opponents to death by trapping in ice that slowly kills their cells or shattering them to pieces once frozen.
