<p>Users are able to use a form of magic that is related to and based on air. For example, one can use this magic to gain access to (esoteric/mystic/magical) air-related abilities (E.g., Air Manipulation) or to cast spells that require or are related to air (E.g., an Astral Projection spell or Healing spell). Air magic draws on the vast sky, the energy and movement of the winds, as well as the power of thunderstorms. It also includes magic that helps one breathe at high altitudes, and a talented air mage can magically enhance their movement, allowing bursts of speed and leaps of great length.
