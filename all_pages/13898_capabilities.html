<p>User can <a href="/wiki/Pain_Inducement" title="Pain Inducement">hurt</a> and <a href="/wiki/Mutilation" title="Mutilation">injure</a> others without killing them. This power is distinct from <a href="/wiki/Immortality_Bestowal" title="Immortality Bestowal">bestowing immortality</a> onto others as those subject to the user's powers are still capable of dying due to natural causes or by third party.
