<p>The user can control the existence of alternate versions of places, people, and things in different, alternate universes and perhaps the universes themselves. They can change the events/life of an object/person or change their overall existence. They can add/remove how many alternate versions of something there is, making more than before, possibly altering their histories, form and such, or making it so there is only one in the multiverse. The user can create something in one universe and proceed to make alternate versions of that something in other universes.
