A mo'o is a shapeshifting lizard spirit. The most common forms of mo'os are monstrous reptiles, tiny geckos, and humans. They also could have power over the weather and water. They are amphibious, and many fishponds in Hawaii were believed to be home to a moʻo. When a moʻo dies, its petrified body becomes part of the landscape.
