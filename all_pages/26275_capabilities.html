<p>The user can create/generate, shape, and manipulate electricity with aÂ distinct property of flowing within or among water particles without a dangerous reaction from the conjunction of these two without the electricity being positively charged. With the increase of conductivity with water particles the emission of electrical charges has now become more powerful than the normal electron generated electricity.
