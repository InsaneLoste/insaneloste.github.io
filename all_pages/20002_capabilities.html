<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate lava/magma of an ancient primordial nature, the same magma that makes up the cores of planets. As opposed to regular Magma Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiment of magma. As such, they can cause natural magma-related effects such as lahars, volcanic eruptions, lava flow and to manifest. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Magma Manipulation as magma is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunities &amp; resistances to magma-based abilities.
