<p>User can link/sync alternate/parallel realities to ones own home reality/universe, allowing the worlds to experience the same passage of time, seasons, distance between locations, etc. as their original world. Since different realities have different time frame rates, such as being either faster or slower then their own world, this would prevent the various time discrepancies from negatively effecting the user after they enter or leave the alternate reality.
