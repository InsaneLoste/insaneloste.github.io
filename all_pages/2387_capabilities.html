<p>Users with this ability can take on the traits of the Baobhan Sith or are one, these are legendary monsters found in Scottish folklore and are depicted as beautiful women who often appear in secluded areas, dancing and singing (almost always appearing in a group, it is considered extremely rare for a Baobhan Sith to appear without at least one other, making them in many ways a pack predator) - they will invite men to dance with them and seduce them, if a man is foolish enough to accept their advances the Baobhan Sith will transform into a horrendous hag-like creature with inhuman strength and violence, in this form the Baobhan Sith proceed to mutilate the victim, drink his blood and then descend into the night in search of a new victim.
