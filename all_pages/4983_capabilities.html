<p>User can target and remove the connections that link together a target's powers and its source, removing their ability to ever use those powers again. This not only prevents them from using their powers, but may even cause them to forget they ever had those powers to begin with, this removes any/all connections and links that the user may have had to the source of their powers, even the smallest ones.
