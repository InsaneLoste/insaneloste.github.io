<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into bomb/explosive, allowing them to act both offensively and defensively by detonating themselves to either attack or defend. Some users may be able to <a href="/wiki/Reforming" title="Reforming">reform</a> themselves after detonation. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of bombs/explosives, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
