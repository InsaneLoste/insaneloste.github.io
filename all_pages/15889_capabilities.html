<p>Users can either be or become into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mokele-mbembe" title="wikipedia:Mokele-mbembe">Mokele-Mbembe</a>, a type of mythical reptile from African folklore (and later "fakelore") that resembles a mix between a dinosaur and a dragon - in the original African folklore they are treated as spirit like creatures but after the 20th century outside influences soon changed the entity into its current form of a more physical river-monster.
