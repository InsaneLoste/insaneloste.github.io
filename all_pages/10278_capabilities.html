<p>User can manipulate formations, or how things form, usually with the use of outside matter, usually things like natural phenomena and groups. The user can manipulate the formation of anything and even how fast it forms. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Creation_Manipulation" title="Creation Manipulation">Creation Manipulation</a>, which can manipulate created things without time and resources, the user has to manipulate formations with time and resources that are involved in making something.
