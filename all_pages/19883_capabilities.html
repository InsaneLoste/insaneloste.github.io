<p>The user can achieve a superior form in between the "base" and "complete" levels. By certain standards, an evolution may require certain perquisites (such as time, amount ingested) to be met before the user can achieve the new form and cannot be reached if anything is missing or removed (resulting in a failure that may cause either regression or even death). This ability allows the user to reach an evolved state without all the necessary steps in place, although with certain drawbacks.
