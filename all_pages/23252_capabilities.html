<p>Users can take a section of space from one location and shift it to another; anything occupying the taken space, whether it is objects, people, or attacks, would be transferred as well; in essence, this is the ability to teleport the area itself. The user can control the size of the taken area, allowing teleportation of a large amount of targets at once, or reducing to partial teleportation without the need to make physical contact with whatever they desire to teleport.
