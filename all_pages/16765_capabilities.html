<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neodymium" title="wikipedia:Neodymium">Neodymium</a>, a soft silvery rare earth metal that tarnishes in air, is not found naturally in metallic form or unmixed with other <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lanthanide" title="wikipedia:Lanthanide">lanthanides</a>, and is usually refined for general use. Although neodymium is classed as a "rare earth", it is a fairly common element, no rarer than cobalt, nickel, and copper, and is widely distributed in the Earth's crust.
