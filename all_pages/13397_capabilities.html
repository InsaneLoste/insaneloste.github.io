They can assume human shape, are good runners and will chase humans. They ambush female travelers and kidnap the beauties by their smell. Having captured a woman who will be their wife, the Jueyuan builds a home for her. Should she not bear a son she is forced to stay with her captor for good and after 10 years her shape becomes like his, with her no longer thinking of home. If she has a child, she is sent home immediately. If she refuses to have a child, she is killed.
