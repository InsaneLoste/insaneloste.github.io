<p>The user can create and utilize poison that is capable of killing absolutely anything once it is introduced into the target's system. Neither <a href="/wiki/Poison_Immunity" title="Poison Immunity">Poison Immunity</a> nor <a href="/wiki/Regenerative_Healing_Factor" title="Regenerative Healing Factor">Regenerative Healing Factor</a> provide defense, nor does an antidote exist, as the chemical composition of the poison can be so complex that no antibodies can be produced against it, or magical in properties that it bypasses any chemical reactions. The poison can even affect inorganic objects, such as stone and wax.
