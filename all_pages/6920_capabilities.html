The "Dominations" or "Dominions" are presented as the hierarchy of celestial beings "Lordships" in some English translations of the De Coelesti Hierarchia. The Dominations regulate the duties of lower angels and make known the commands of God. It is only with extreme rarity that the angelic lords make themselves physically known to humans. Dominions also are channels of mercy.
