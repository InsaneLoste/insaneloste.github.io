<p>User can access the powers granted to them through a specific mode/form without the need for tranform into it, granting them immunity to powers like <a href="/wiki/Mode_Lock" title="Mode Lock">Mode Lock</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shapeshifting_Negation" title="Shapeshifting Negation">Shapeshifting Negation</a>. Simply put, the user <i>retains</i> whatever powers they normally gain by transforming into whatever mode/form which grants them to them while they are untransformed.
