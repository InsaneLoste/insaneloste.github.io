<p>The user can defend against attacks without their will of defending, as in that it is automatic and without the user's control. This defensive performance can be triggered just like <a href="/wiki/Automatic_Attack" title="Automatic Attack">Automatic Attack</a>, but instead, the user goes on defense, and that grants protection to whatever. If the automatic defense protects the user, if not anything else, then users can automatically gain counters, evasions, and even create shields on themselves for protection of strikes.
