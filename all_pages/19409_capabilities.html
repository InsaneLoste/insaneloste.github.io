<p>Users, either innately or through training, are masters of wielding <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Polearm" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">polearms</a>, a close combat weapon in which the main fighting part of the weapon is fitted to the end of a long shaft, typically of wood, thereby extending the user's effective range and striking power. The user is able to wield any kind of polearm with great speed, power, and skill. As one of the largest (or at least longest) classes of weapon that can be carried by normal humans, users of this ability excel in keeping enemies at bay and maintaining a superior position in combat, having a great advantage, at a distance, over opponents wielding smaller mêlée weapons.
