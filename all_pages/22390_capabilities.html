<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Shiryo or are one, a Shiryo is a malevolent ghost similar to an Onryo or a Goryo but seem to have a lesser degree of power, this does not make them any less dangerous to those they haunt - often they appear very shortly after death and target family or friends, who they may manifest to and in some cases they will go as far as dragging their victims into the afterlife with them.
