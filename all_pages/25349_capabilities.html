<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into string, thread, or yarn. The userâ€™s transformed form can be anatomically identical to their normal form aside of being made of string, in which case it may contain all organs. Alternately user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other, or a two-dimensional outline of their normal form.
