<p>The user is or can transform into a gestalt form of a dragon; a potential fusion of a dragon combining with different species together to create a brand-new kind of unique dragon with all of their respected powers, traits, abilities and skills mix in as one. Depending on what kind of gestalt form they have, this can give a user a lot of diversity. For example, fusing an Asian and Western Dragon together will create a new dragon with both abilities and even combining with a dinosaur to create a Dino-Dragon a creature with the primal instinct of a dinosaur combined with the supernatural powers of a dragon.
