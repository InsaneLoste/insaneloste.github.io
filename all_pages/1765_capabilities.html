<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a suit of armor. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of base matter, in which case it contains all their organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternatively, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
