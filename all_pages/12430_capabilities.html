<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into an <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ikuchi" title="wikipedia:Ikuchi">ikuchi</a>, an extremely large sea-monster from Japanese folklore that resembled a gigantic serpent or eel - sometimes as large as several kilometers in length - inhabiting the deepest oceans. These creatures were terrifying but slow-moving predators that would secrete a sticky oil that they would use in combination with their powerful coils to capture boats and pretty much anything else they desired, constricting them until they sank and devouring any onboard.
