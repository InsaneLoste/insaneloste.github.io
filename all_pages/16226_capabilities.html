<p>The user has the power to create/summon multiple guardians either as physical or purely spiritual being, with appearances varying greatly ranging from humanoid (with various weaponry and skills) to animal or even mythical beings or even items like weapons, gadgets, vehicles, or just everyday items. The guardians will act to protect the user at all costs and fights on their behalf. The guardian's strength may be driven by the user's force of will or physical movements, or by its own independent will.
