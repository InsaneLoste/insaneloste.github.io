<p>Users of this ability can either take on the traits of or are a reptoid - a type of malevolent alien found in many modern world folklores, especially those surrounding hidden races deep below the Earth or aliens from deep space: in many legends the reptoids are lizard-like monsters that either came from space or were the original inhabitants of Earth before humans took over. As most documented, reptoids are known to have a xenophobic belief that they are the "master race" of the universe and views other races that are not reptoid, including humans, as inferior.
