<p>The user can effectively have great density of power, matter, energy and force despite either being or turned (by someone or something else) skinny, average looking, small, weak bodied or old. They do not need a large body to contain their impressive strength, speed, durability and agility, and do not need to worry about bursting, leaking or exploding with such power. The user can thus do things impressive or otherwise impossible for the user themselves to do. They also don't lose their abilities when they are turned from their normal structure, whatever that may be, to skinny, small, etc.
