<p>The user exists in a deep and all-encompassing state of autopilot. The userâ€™s consciousness does exist, but they have, through some mechanism, relinquished or suppressed all control and awareness of every facet of themselves, causing everything to occur instinctively and spontaneously, without any conscious input; moving, eating, fighting, walking, talking (even complex topics and natural conversations), making decisions, using their powers, feeling and displaying emotions, feeling pain, etc.
