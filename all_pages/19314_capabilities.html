<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate poisons and fire combined. This can come in the form of either generating poisoned fire that can burn and poison someone at the same time, generating a gas-like poisoned fire that burns everything and everyone on its path, or generate a burning poison gas that, if inhaled, burns the victims from inside their body; in the case of burning poison gas, it doesn't even need to be breathed, as it can usually enter the body through the skin. The poisoned fire generally inflicts terrible pain and may even cause instant death.
