<p>The user can induce sleep paralysis, a condition in which oneâ€™s mind is awake while their body is still in a sleeping state. This is caused when a person isn't smoothly waking or falling asleep. This causes a person to become immobilize and hallucinate while their mind is attempting to become awake. There are two types of sleep paralysis, hypnagogic and hypnopompic. Hypnagogic occurs as a person falls asleep and occur with closed eyes or in total darkness. Hypnopompic occurs after a person wakes up and occur with open eyes within illuminated environment. Hypnopompic a far less common than hypnagogic hallucinations. These hallucination project themselves into physical space and tend to feel real and physical.
