<p>User is highly proficient in using <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkour" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">parkour</a>, which can be summed up as either acrobatics meets assault courses or skateboarding without a board. It is based on general principles of survival: Should one ever need to get from Point A to Point B as fast as possible, the shortest distance is always a straight line. The goal, therefore, is to get past, over, under, or through various obstacles without wasting any time.
