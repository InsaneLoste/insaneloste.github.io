<p>The user can regenerate/resurrect themselves, if all their "pieces" are together. The "pieces" could be parts of their body, mind and/or soul (If a dead person was to allocate all the parts of their souls, they could regenerate their soul or resurrect in a less-restrained <a href="/wiki/Astral_Projection" title="Astral Projection">astral form</a>, etc.). The user could do it consciously, or not (If the user's body was destroyed, someone else could put the parts together to reform their body.).
