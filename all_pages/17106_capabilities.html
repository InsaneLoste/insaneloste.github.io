<p>The user is made of or can transform their body completely into non-elemental forces, forces and powers that exist outside of a conventional elemental system and thus don't follow the same rules. A user's transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of element, in which case, it contains all organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
