<p>Users can create inner worlds within themselves or others (minds, souls, etc), that they are able to manipulate anything in any way they want with little to no limits at all: they can control time, space, reality, gravity, weather, and anything they can think by their will and desire. Users may even have a nexus/matrix system within their world that defines the functions of the inner nature of their world thatâ€™s bound to the user. Additionally, the inner worlds of some users may manifest as <a href="/wiki/Dimensional_Manipulation" title="Dimensional Manipulation">extra-dimensional</a> <a href="/wiki/Space-Time_Manipulation" title="Space-Time Manipulation">spaces</a> rather than solely being <a href="/wiki/Mental_World_Manipulation" title="Mental World Manipulation">metaphysical</a>, <a href="/wiki/Mind_Palace" title="Mind Palace">conceptual</a>, <a href="/wiki/Dream_Manipulation" title="Dream Manipulation">oneiric</a>, <a href="/wiki/Imaginary_Environment_Manipulation" title="Imaginary Environment Manipulation">imaginary</a>, <a href="/wiki/Illusion_Manipulation" title="Illusion Manipulation">illusory</a> or <a href="/wiki/Simulation_Manipulation" title="Simulation Manipulation">simulated</a> <a href="/wiki/Environment_Manipulation" title="Environment Manipulation">environments</a>.
