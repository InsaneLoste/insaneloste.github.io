<p>The user processes visual information at an accelerated rate, on the speed that they can see things even when moving at high speed, making them unable to miss a thing, no matter how fast they go. They can see/process visual information with a very short time, see objects when they are moving fast, see things that may be otherwise too fast, allowing them to discern the sight with enough time to react to whatever caused it, etc.
