<ul><li>Depending on the system's variation, the number of boosters and abilities that can be obtained changes.</li>
<li>Depending on the system's variation, it's possible to block or seal something special that the users could've achieved.</li>
<li>If the system uses a level-based growing with skill points at each level, depending on the maximum level that can be reached, it's possible the user may not reach the maximum level of each skill, leaving one or more unlearned or incomplete.</li>
<li>If the system forces the user to choose a class (look <a class="text" href="https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Class_System" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Class System</a>), any growth might be limited to the parameters and skillsets of the particular class.</li>
<li>If the system forces the user to choose a class (look <a class="text" href="https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Class_System" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Class System</a>), it's possible that the chosen class could not be changed.</li>
<li>In a points-based system, it's possible that the points needed to increase a parameter/skill are shared (For example: If users were to put points into a certain parameter/skill, they might not be unable to input points to put into another parameter/skill, thus restricting them from maxing out certain parameters/skills).</li>
<li>In the External Learning variation, separation from the party or party member(s) that are the source of the skill may result in the reset of the learning, forcing the user to learn the skill from scratch.</li>
<li>If the system uses the Chip variation, then a "quest system" is added as the only way for obtaining both chips and alternative plates, the "strength" of the chips and plates is pair to the difficulty of the quest so stronger chips and plates can be obtained ONLY completing very difficult quests, the ultimate chips and plates are obtained only via very difficult quests that can be done only one time.</li>
<li>In the idle variation, the "Training Grounds" have rankings and can only have a limited number of resources. This can result in the player having a limited amount of accessibility to the ground or a limit to how high skill can be upgraded.</li>
<li>In the Idle Type 1 variation, it is possible that the system will use a device or interface as a vector for advancement. Meaning that the user can't go to an actual area to enhance themselves or bring something from the grounds to the real world.</li>
<li>In the Idle Type 2 variation, resources can't be used on anything outside of the game and there could be a limited amount of time in which they can be used.</li></ul>
