<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Metal_Manipulation" title="Metal Manipulation">Metal Manipulation</a> can over-ride the user's control.</li>
<li>Controlled lead is affected by everything that normal lead would be, although the user is perfectly able to use their power to return the metal in its original shape and/or controlling it even under these forces:
<ul><li>melt under extreme heat (<a href="/wiki/Fire_Manipulation" title="Fire Manipulation">Fire Manipulation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Magma_Manipulation" title="Magma Manipulation">Magma Manipulation</a>).</li>
<li>turn brittle and shatter under extreme cold (<a href="/wiki/Freezing" title="Freezing">Freezing</a>).</li></ul></li>
<li>Lead is a particularly soft metal and doesn't hold its shape well.</li>
<li>Lead is highly poisonous and can harm the user unless they have resistance to its toxicity.</li>
<li>Distance, mass, precision, etc. depend upon of the knowledge, skill, and strength of the user, and their power's natural limits.</li></ul>
