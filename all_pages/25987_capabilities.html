<p>The user can deny what is real in the world by lying to themselves, the user literally lies to everything on all levels (including meta, absolute, omni, etc), effectively making facts be based on lies. The difference between this power and truth manipulation is, while truth manipulation technically enables the user to alter reality by turning lies true. This power views reality as a sentient being lies to it and makes reality accept those lies.
