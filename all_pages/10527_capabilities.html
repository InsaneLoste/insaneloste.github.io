<p>The user either is or can mimic/transform into a lifeform (animal, plant, etc.) of a species that exists only in the future.  While this character may also be a <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Time_Traveler_from_the_Future" title="Archetype:Time Traveler from the Future">time traveler from the future</a>, this is not intrinsic to the archetype; the character may exist in the future, or the character may have transformed into a species that does not yet exist.
