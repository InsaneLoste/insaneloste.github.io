<p>The user has authority and duty over the <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Abyss_(religion)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">abyss</a>, the realm where souls go into an eternal void to endure absolute isolation from everything in existence. Some would call this a fate worse then even Hell itself, as souls are forever doomed to wallow alone without love or peace, forever losing bits and pieces of who they are into <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Eternal_oblivion" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">eternal oblivion</a> until they become nothing. Some users gain control over a certain part of abyss where they command everything and everyone in the area and gain a lot of power whenever they are in the void itself.
