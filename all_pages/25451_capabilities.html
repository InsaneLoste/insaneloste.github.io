<p>The user can generate timed events to happen in any point in the space-time continuum, whether they are in the past, present or future. If someone tries to change the past, then the user would time the moment they enter the past to stop them from changing it. If someone tries to go against what was foretold in the future, then a timed event will keep them on track.
