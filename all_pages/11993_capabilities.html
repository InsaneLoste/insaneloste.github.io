<p>The user with this ability ability either is or can transform into a Hope Deity, a god/goddess that is associated with Hope. They are not common in history and very little is known about them. This power grants the user absolute knowledge and dominion over hope, capable of giving hope to others and stripping people of it. Hope Deities despite not being common in history, can be attributed to desire deities due to the saying "Hopes and Dreams can fulfill one's heart."
