<p>The user can heal themselves or others with the use of coins. The coins they can use to heal can either be a specific, special coin, or any coin. The user's healing can depend on the coin they use, for example, a quarter heals the user more than a nickel. They may also be able to heal from coins just from collecting them, or from consuming them.
