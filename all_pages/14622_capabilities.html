<p>Users possess the traits, attributes, characteristics and/or abilities of machines, including robots, <a href="/wiki/Technorganic_Physiology" title="Technorganic Physiology">cyborgs</a>, <a href="/wiki/Android_Physiology" title="Android Physiology">androids</a>, etc. They achieve this either through full or partial transformation into machines, choosing to mimic certain aspects of them, or simply already being a robot in the first place. This can include small factories instead of organs, which can manifest instruments such as mechanical limbs, weapons, or wheels. Some may be limited to specific mechanisms or parts to which their body can operate, other abilities may be limited only by their imagination.
