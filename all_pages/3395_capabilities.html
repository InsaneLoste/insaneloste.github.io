<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bovinae" title="wikipedia:Bovinae">bovines</a>, medium to large-sized ungulates including cattle, bison, African buffalo, water buffaloes, and the four-horned and spiral-horned antelopes. They can command, speak/understand, evolve/devolve, merge with, possess, etc., with all forms of bovines. Weaker users can only influence their behavior, commanding them to do their bidding.
