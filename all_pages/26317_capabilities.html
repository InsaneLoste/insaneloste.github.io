<p>User can undo any wound, disease, injury on another living being that that has been healed or cured. This can be done to impair an opponent, or undo cures that get rid of diseases. With some skill, some users can even make it so that the wounds and injuries undone not only heal again slowly, but make them not heal at all as well.
