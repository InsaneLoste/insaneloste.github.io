<p>User can rebuild/recreate/restore any/all traces of civilization and its countless aspects, allowing them to completely restore society regardless of how badly its been damaged/destroyed or removed. Any thing that is represented by civilization will be rebuilt whether its art, culture, society, economy, technology, tools, communications, etc. even if nothing but fading memories of civilization remains or the land on which it once stood is gone.
