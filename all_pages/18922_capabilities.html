<p>The user can negate physical forces on themselves, others or objects. These forces include friction, pressure, gravity, deformation forces, torque, action-reaction forces, etc. They can negate the net forces acting on an object so that they can remain in equilibrium by having balanced forces, or eliminate other forces acting on an object until there is just one acting on it.
