<p>The user either is or can mimim/transform into an inkanyamba, a legendary African serpent that lives in waterfall lake areas. Some say it is a snake; other say it is an eel. According to the Xhosa's account of the myth, the Inkanyamba will ascend to the sky in the form of a tornado once a year to find a mate. It is also said that they are the cause of seasonal storms, even when angered.
