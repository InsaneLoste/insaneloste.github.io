<p>The user can make things spin, and make anything spin faster or slower, change the direction of rotation, etc. They can make the air spin to create tornadoes or projectiles spin to change its trajectory, incite overwhelming friction that can elevate temperature and even trigger centralized explosions. They can also create artificial gravity by spinning the air around themselves.
