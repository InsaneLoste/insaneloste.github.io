<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pressure" title="wikipedia:Pressure">pressure</a>, the amount of force applied perpendicular to the surface of an object per unit area. They can move objects over distance, strengthen gravitational pull, pseudo-solidify non-solid objects by generating a repulsive pressure exertion field around them, crushing of material targets, reduce friction between targets, etc.
