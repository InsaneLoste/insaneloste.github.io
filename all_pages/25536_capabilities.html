<p>The user can ignore any/all torques and their laws, including those exerted on them and/or how they apply torque. Torque is what causes change in angular acceleration, and is force times lever arm length (or the length of something applying the force), so doubling the force or lever arm length doubles torque while halving the force or lever arm halves torque. The user can exert high torques with smaller lever arms or forces, allowing for a variety of possibilities when it comes to moving. The user can also defy the torques they exert, so that whether applying torque at the center or edge of an object, the object does not rotate.
