<p>Users embody oblivion and ignorance, the lack of knowledge or awareness. At the most fundamental level, users would possess key physical characteristics and/or personality traits related to the concept they're personifying. Most users that embody oblivion would possess abilities and traits that can distort or outright erase another's knowledge, memories, cognition, or even consciousness itself. Most of the time, they can induce unawareness and ignorance in others, causing them to be oblivious in battle. It can also be used offensively, as they can use their conceptual representation to delude others into believing them. The users' capabilities can be tied to their sheer ignorance, hence hard to stop out of Dunning-Kruger bravado or mere obliviousness.
