<p>The user has undergone one or more mutations that <a href="/wiki/Power_Bestowal" title="Power Bestowal">granted new abilities</a>, <a href="/wiki/Power_Augmentation" title="Power Augmentation">enhanced existing abilities</a>, or did a combination of both. Empowering mutations are generally a <a href="/wiki/Trait:Double-Edged_Power" title="Trait:Double-Edged Power">Double-Edged</a> transformation as they are often accompanied with a shocking aesthetic transformation of the character. This visual change can make it difficult for the character to function normally within their society as they generate feelings of discomfort (including fear and disgust) amongst citizens.
