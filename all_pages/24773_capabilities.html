<p>User either has the lower body of animal or is able to transform their lower body into other animal forms.

Note that there are variations who, instead of human upper portion, have <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Anthropomorphism" title="Anthropomorphism">anthropomorphic</a> version of their animal form and <i>do</i> have the bite.
