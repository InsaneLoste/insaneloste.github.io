<p>User can craft/forge materials/objects that are able to do things that are normally impossible for them or the material they are made out of to do so. They can craft things, such a tiny dagger that's even sharper and more deadly than a full-size sword or a piece of armor that can defend against things that would normally shatter it or even use materials that are normally stressed/weakened by forging somehow become stronger than normal.
