<p>Users can sculpt and shape sounds and other ambient noises, changing them in any way imaginable, such as changing the sound of rainfall to sound like a lions roar. They can alter existing sounds or even add sounds, such as voices, where none existed before, including changing the qualities of any sound such as making it sound better and clearer or even increase the range and volume of sounds.
