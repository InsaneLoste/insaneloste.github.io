<p>Users are able to wield a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stick-fighting" title="wikipedia:Stick-fighting">staff</a> or stick-like weapon with supernatural proficiency in speed, power, dexterity, and skill, allowing them to perform seemingly impossible feats with ease, such as performing nigh or impossible feats of improvision, manipulate their staff as an extensive of themselves or bodies, shatter the very air itself with a simple swing, destroy entire landmass such as mountains, rend large objects into mere pieces with ease, block or deflect things that should be impossible to perceive, extend the length of one's staff without looking or moving, and turn a simple walking stick into a weapon of great power.
