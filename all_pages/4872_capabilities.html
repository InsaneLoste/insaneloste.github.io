<p>User can manipulate the abstracts (or concept) of light. This can have many feats, such as light that can prevent darkness from existing, generate light that sheds cold instead of warmth, light that makes things dimmer instead of brighter, produce light that can exist without darkness/shadow, generate light that drains/reduces energy rather the charging it, make light negate other forms of illumination, harm things that can <a href="/wiki/Light_Absorption" title="Light Absorption">absorb</a> or are <a href="/wiki/Photokinetic_Immunity" title="Photokinetic Immunity">immune</a> to photons/light, and much more.
