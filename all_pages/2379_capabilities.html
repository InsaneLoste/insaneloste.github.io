<p>The user is able to manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Banishing" title="wikipedia:Banishing">banishment</a>, the act of removing or expelling various entities from certain locations. With this power, the user does not simply banish beings; they can also manipulate banished entities, their actual banishing ability, the power wielded by the respective parties and possibly even cancel out the power itself. Potentially, one can control where one is banished, for how long and conditions that cause the removal.
