<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate crystals/gems of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Crystal Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiment of crystal. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Crystal Manipulation as crystal is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunity to crystal based abilities.
