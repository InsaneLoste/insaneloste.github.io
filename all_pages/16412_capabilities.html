<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muzzle_energy" title="wikipedia:Muzzle energy">muzzle energy</a>, the energy of a bullet or other projectile as it is launched from a firearm’s muzzle. The overall value of the energy comes from multiplying one-half times the bullet’s mass times its velocity squared. Moving objects possess kinetic energy. The bigger the bullet’s mass and velocity, the greater the amount of muzzle kinetic energy, which also translates to greater destructive power. With this ability, one can heighten the overall energy of the projectile (i.e., strengthening the energy of a handgun’s bullet to mimic the force of a cannon shot) to amplify the damaging effects or possibly diminish it to lessen the impact.
