<p>The user either is or can transform into a godly poltergeist of unholy horrors. Normal poltergeists are only capable of regular noisy ghost physiology powers like Telekinesis for instance, but transcendent poltergeists are powerful beyond imagination, since they can warp reality to a massive degree, induce and manipulate illusions, create supernatural anomalies, etc. in order to cause mischief, harm, and timidity in other people they haunt as they see fit.
