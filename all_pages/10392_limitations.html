<li>As the temperature of ice is severely below that of a human's, excessive use of the ability may cause detrimental issues like frostbite.</li>
<li>Distance, mass, precision, etc. depend upon of the knowledge, skill, and strength of the user, and their power's natural limits.</li>
<li>May be unable to create ice, being limited to manipulating only from already existing sources.
<ul><li>The creation of ice may depend on the amount of moisture available; dry areas could make this difficult or impossible.</li></ul></li>
<li>Ice is affected by everything that normal ice would be, although the user is perfectly able to use their power to return the ice in its original shape and/or controlling it even under these forces:
<ul><li>Melt under extreme heat (<a href="/wiki/Fire_Manipulation" title="Fire Manipulation">Fire Manipulation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Heat_Manipulation" title="Heat Manipulation">Heat Manipulation</a>, <a href="/wiki/Magma_Manipulation" title="Magma Manipulation">Magma Manipulation</a>, etc.).</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Vibration_Emission" title="Vibration Emission">Vibrations</a> are difficult (if not impossible) to freeze, as they cause the ice to shatter, making <a href="/wiki/Sound_Manipulation" title="Sound Manipulation">sound-based</a> abilities a perfect counter.</li></ul></li></ul>
