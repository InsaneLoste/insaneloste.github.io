<p>The user can warp or generate space//spatial energy in order to create an armor of space around themselves. By encasing themselves in the fabric of space, the user essentially removes themselves from regular space and exist inside of the armor while they continue to wear it. Once the armor is removed or destroyed, the user is pulled back into regular space again.
