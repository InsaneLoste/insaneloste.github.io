<p>Users can form a sacred and powerful union between them and an esper, or beings with psychic/ESP abilities, and they both tend to protect and care for one another and assist each other in multiple situations. Users can also share an empowering friendship so that they draw strength from and grant them the power to achieve anything and overcome potential obstacles in their way. The bond they have with their espers is purely sacred because of the pure love they have for one another and use it to synchronize each other and gain a variety of powers they use for themselves.
