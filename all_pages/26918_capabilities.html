<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a vodyanoy, a frog-like water spirit of Slavic folklore.  It appears as a humanoid spirit with a frog-like face. It is also malevolent in nature and takes pleasure in dragging any unlucky bather underwater and drowning them. Sometimes, it will drag people to its underwater home to serve as its slave. It will sometimes shapeshift in order to deceive its victims.
