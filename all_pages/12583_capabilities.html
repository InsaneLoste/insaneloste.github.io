<p>The users have or can generate an innate armor as a part of their body, which is resistant to attacks, harm or pain, and temperature extremes. The armor varies from obvious, physical defenses, such as scales, thick skin/fur, natural shield, armor or shell, in-organic skin, etc, to bone-nodules below the skin, particularly wide/sturdy rib cage, blubber, or simply dense muscle.
