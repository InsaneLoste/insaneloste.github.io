<p>The user either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Futakuchi-onna" title="wikipedia:Futakuchi-onna">futakuchi-onna</a>, a type of female yokai characterized by their two mouths â€“ a normal one located on her face and second one on the back of the head beneath the hair. There, the woman's skull splits apart, forming lips, teeth and a tongue, creating an entirely functional second mouth. Some depictions have the creative liberties of, despite keeping the name literally meaning two mouths, giving the yokai more than two mouths. They have prehensile hair, although whether this is under their conscious control varies. Aside of their mouth, they appear perfectly normal women.
