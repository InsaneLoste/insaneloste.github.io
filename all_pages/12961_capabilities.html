<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate the worlds within oneself and/or others (hearts, minds, souls, bodies, etc.), controlling time, space, reality, gravity, weather, and anything they can think by their will and desire. High-level users can even externalize the inner worlds, making them a physical environment, or bring others into it.
