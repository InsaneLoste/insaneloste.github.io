<p>Users, either innately or through training, are masters of <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Native_American_religion" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Native American religion</a>, the spiritual practices of the indigenous peoples of North America. Ceremonial ways can vary widely and are based on the differing histories and beliefs of individual nations, tribes and bands. Early European explorers describe individual Native American tribes and even small bands as each having their own religious practices. Theology may be monotheistic, polytheistic, henotheistic, animistic, shamanistic, pantheistic or any combination thereof, among others. Traditional beliefs are usually passed down in the forms of oral histories, stories, allegories, and principles.
