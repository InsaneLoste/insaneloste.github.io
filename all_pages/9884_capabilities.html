<p>The user has total dominion over fire and absolute control over its elements. The user can decimate entire areas with their control and maintain complete manipulation over fire and heat. Usually users of this power are either a <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Fire_Deity" title="Archetype:Fire Deity">god of fire</a> or <a href="/wiki/Fire_Embodiment" title="Fire Embodiment">fire itself</a> but users of this power don't have to be of divine origin or a living concept. In certain cases, users may be lord over a specific type of fire.
