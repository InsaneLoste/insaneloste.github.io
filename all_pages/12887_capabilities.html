<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate elemental forces derived from their inner beast. The innate creature possesses natural powers (such as air, fire, water, earth, etc.) that the user can access and control according to their will. Because of their unique, bestial nature, the elements being manipulated may have special aspects and effects not normally found elsewhere, either in the natural world or among other elemental power users.
