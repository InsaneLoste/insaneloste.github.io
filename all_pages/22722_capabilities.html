<p>Users become an embodiment of sloth and gain power from laziness of others and oneself, users can even use sloth of others or oneself to transform into a more powerful form. The user can make the enemies lack motivation to attack or want to do anything. They can summon other beings to fight in their stead, and can cause others to commit suicide from not wanting to do anything.
