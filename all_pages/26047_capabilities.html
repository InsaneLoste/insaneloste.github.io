<p>The user shares or possesses abilities similar/different to their twin sibling. Some twins can only activate their powers when they make physical contact with each other. Some twins may possess opposite abilities from one another. If the user has more than one twin sibling (like triplets, quadruplets, quintuplets, sextuplets, septuplets, or more), then they either possess opposite abilities or can only activate their powers when making physical contact. Though if the siblings possess the same/different abilities, sometimes the siblings' powers are more powerful together than apart.
