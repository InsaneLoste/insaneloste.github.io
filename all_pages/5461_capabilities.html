<p>The user can ignore any/all distance and distance related effects and factors of physical concepts, such as work (how much energy is used over a distance), torque, moment of inertia, velocity and anything that may be affected by distance, especially things that tend to decrease with distance. This also works on volume/size (distance cubed) and area (distance squared) such as the strength-weight ratio (weight increases with size).
