<p>User exists beyond the concepts of time and space and as such are immune to anything rooted in such concepts that would affect or harm them. If time should stop then they would not be affected, if reality would change, they would remember both the previous and have knowledge of differences from the old to the new. If the area around the user explodes or the planet which they are on vanish or does not exist anymore the user is not affected since they do not exist inside space.
