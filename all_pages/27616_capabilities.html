<p>The user can subjugate any sentient and non-sentient beings to their control through pure respect, reverence and sheer adoration for the user as they become completely willing to follow the user's will. At first, they grow attached and warm up to the user, then start to put the user into a pedestal, taking what the user says as final by implicit trust, ending up as seeing the user as an awe-inspiring example to <i>follow</i>. Through the user's desires they are held as a figure that is held as a god, a messiah, a divine king or a similar icon by his or her supporters who become willing to lay their lives down to protect and/or serve the user.
