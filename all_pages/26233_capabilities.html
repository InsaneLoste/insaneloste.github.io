Already formidable creatures in life, the undead giants simply grow even stronger when they are turned undead, often being used either as engines of mass-destruction by necromancers or undead armies but also sometimes being the commanders of their own legions of undead. Some, such as the infamous Jack-In-Irons, are solitary monsters and all of them are greatly feared as some of the more powerful subtypes of the undead.
