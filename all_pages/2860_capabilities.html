<p>The user of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Psychometry_(paranormal)" title="wikipedia:Psychometry (paranormal)">psychometry</a> obtains historical memories or sensations concerning beings and objects they observe. With objects, they gain knowledge including the makers, users, and even those who have on passing used the object, and what has been done with it. With living beings or parts of the body, the user learns their general life-history but doesn't gain anything of what they were thinking or feeling.
