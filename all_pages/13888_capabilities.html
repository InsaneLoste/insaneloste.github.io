<p>The user is or has the ability to take on the form of a Lesser Dragon and/or other dragon-like beings. Variations or mimicry of <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dragon" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Dragons</a> tend to lack the size, magical abilities and/or intelligence of the more ancient dragons, and are generally more animal-like in mind and behavior. The most common distinction in physiology, however, is the number and location of legs and presence (or lack thereof) of wings/flight. While traditional dragons tend to be rather large and generally have vast magic/intelligence, this isn't to say they that various depictions of lesser dragons cannot have those characteristics, and that's generally defined by the given setting.
