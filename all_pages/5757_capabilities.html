<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_elves_in_fiction" title="wikipedia:Dark elves in fiction">dark elf</a>, a subterranean race that has more in common with the beings that would later be identified as dwarves. Dark elves are typically identified as a corrupted version of their nobler brethren and are known for their aggression, deceit, and stealth. They are very brutal and cruel by nature, having little mercy when it comes to cheating, battling, or anything dealing with the life of another being. They have little respect for even their own kind, at times waging war against each other. However, clans are known to band together to combat invasions and attacks by other races. Many dwell underground.
