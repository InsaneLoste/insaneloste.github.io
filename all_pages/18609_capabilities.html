<p>The user can manipulate their own personal ghost/specter, calling on a unique spiritual figure that can serve the user in some fashion. Phantasms come in a variety of shapes, sizes and temperaments; thus, they can manifest various powers depending on their nature. The relationship can be the result of being born of the userâ€™s own body, a supernatural summons or having a contract created, whether willfully (<a href="/wiki/Contract_Bestowal" title="Contract Bestowal">Contract Bestowal</a>) or through manipulation (<a href="/wiki/Submission" title="Submission">Submission</a>). Whatever the circumstances, the ghost/specter will enable the user capabilities that can range from acting as a personal attack spirit to potentially combining with the user to enhance their own power (<a href="/wiki/Spiritual_Symbiosis" title="Spiritual Symbiosis">Spiritual Symbiosis</a>).
