<li>Subjects with effectual eye lessness, or in another case, those that have <a href="/wiki/Eyeless_Perception" title="Eyeless Perception">Eyeless Perception</a> are immune. Due to the user of Illusory Vision having to require their vision to control others, the eye roots that happen to transfer visual information into the brain to simulate eyesight are not there, meaning this will make the power useless.</li>
<li>Direct eye contact may be needed, so breaking it will break the illusions.</li>
<li>Will not work if the victim is blind.</li>
<li>May require close eye contact.</li>
<li>Contact lenses or glasses may limit or cancel this power's intensity.</li>
<li>Target may have to be physically present, meaning it may not work if the user tries to cast an illusion on someone on a talk screen.</li>
<li>May not work if either the user or victim has only one eye or has lazy eye or is near/farsighted and is not wearing glasses.</li></ul>
