<p>Users can create, shape, move, control, interact and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vibration" title="wikipedia:Vibration">vibrations</a>, a mechanical phenomenon whereby oscillations occur about an equilibrium point. Thus, they can manipulate vibrations in themselves, others, objects, the environment/surrounding, etc., through the ground, water, or air. Vibration is a very overarching concept and phenomenon that affects almost everything on a physical level, including sound, temperature and shockwaves, allowing users to exert their power over them.
