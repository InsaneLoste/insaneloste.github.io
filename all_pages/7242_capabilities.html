<p>Users, either innately or through training, are capable of wielding two different weapons with ease in combat (i.e., a sword and shield, katana or a broadsword, and commonly twin swords). The weapons in question are normally bladed weaponry and/or firearms, but it can be virtually any melee and/or ranged weapon. Because of this, the user is able to deal twice the damage to their opponent quickly, swiftly, and effectively. They're also able to hold their own against multiple enemies at multiple angles, allowing them to fight and take advantage of wide openings. Users wield twin weapons like Sais, guns, twin sword (they look exactly the same), etc. Other users also wield two different weapons at the same time as a sword and shield or two different kinds of swords.
