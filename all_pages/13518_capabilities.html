Since kickboxing is a broad term, understanding the history can be somewhat difficult, since combat is an inherent part of being human. Kicking and punching as an act of human aggression have probably existed throughout the world since prehistory. However, the term 'kickboxing' originated in Japan, in the 1960s, and developed in the late 1950s from <a href="/wiki/Karate_Mastery" title="Karate Mastery">Karate</a> mixed with <a href="/wiki/Boxing_Mastery" title="Boxing Mastery">Boxing</a>, with <a href="/wiki/Tae_Kwon_Do_Mastery" title="Tae Kwon Do Mastery">Taekwondo</a>, <a href="/wiki/Muay_Thai_Mastery" title="Muay Thai Mastery">Muay Thai</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Savate_Mastery" title="Savate Mastery">Savate</a>.
