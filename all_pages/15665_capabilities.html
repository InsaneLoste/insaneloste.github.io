Not only does it augment their vision, but it also grants extra abilities as well, including but not limited to seeing in the dark, perceiving the electromagnetic spectrum, perceive things that are too small for the naked eye, see distant objects and beings in a magnified scale, and even have incredible accuracy and/or precision.
