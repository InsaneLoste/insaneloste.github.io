<p>The user can absorb their duplicates or multiple presences back into a single self, and use this in various ways, gaining some form of advantage, either by enhancing themselves, gaining the drained power, using it as power source etc., either temporarily or permanently. Usually this involves absorbing the memories, skills and experiences of the duplicate. They can also use merging as a form of healing by absorbing an uninjured copy. Usually, users of this ability re-absorb their clones when they are not needed, thus returning to their original self to strength. Duplicate absorption can also be done to save energy or mental capacity by minimizing the effort required to sustain multiple presences.
