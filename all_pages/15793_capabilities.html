Modern depiction typically shows minotaur as <a href="/wiki/Humanoid_Physiology" title="Humanoid Physiology">humanoid</a> with the head, legs, tail, and hide of a bovine. More classical depictions of minotaur present a <a href="/wiki/Theriocephalic_Physiology" title="Theriocephalic Physiology">Theriocephalic Physiology</a> with a bovine head on an otherwise fully human body (including human legs and skin).
