<li>Users of <a href="/wiki/Teleportation_Prediction" title="Teleportation Prediction">Teleportation Prediction</a> can predict where the user is teleporting.</li>
<li>Users may be susceptible to telefrag, and/or may accidentally kill their peers with telefrag when attempting to bring them along.</li>
<li>Can still be affected by <a href="/wiki/Warp_Travel_Unravel" title="Warp Travel Unravel">Warp Travel Unravel</a> and <a href="/wiki/Warp_Travel_Interaction" title="Warp Travel Interaction">Warp Travel Interaction</a>.</li>
<li>Momentum may be conserved when teleporting, meaning that a being cannot simply avoid the damage in the midst of falling by just teleporting to the ground. <i>See Also: <a class="external text" href="http://tvtropes.org/pmwiki/pmwiki.php/Main/InertiaIsACruelMistress" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Inertia Is a Cruel Mistress</a></i>
<ul><li>Conversely, all teleported objects may lose their speed completely.</li></ul></li>
<li>Teleporting may take time, i.e. user may need to concentrate for a certain time before the transportation happens.</li>
<li>If the user's power is calculation-based, low intellect and stress may hinder ability.</li>
<li>If the time-space coordinate which user is teleporting to is already occupied, they may get thrown to another location, or suffer some other sort of teleportation malfunction.</li>
<li>May not be able to teleport other teleporters due to a spatial contradiction.</li>
<li>May be unable to teleport while under stress or in shock, e.g. being in the vacuum of space without a spacesuit.</li>
<li>May need to know/sense/have been to the area which they are teleporting to do so properly.</li>
<li>The users' teleportation may be limited when the Spatial Cognizance is being interfered with, such as rain, chaff, or anything that emits spatial noise.</li>
<li>Teleportation may cause a spatial disturbance, allowing highly sensitive opponents to track down their destination.</li></ul>
