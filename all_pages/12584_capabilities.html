<p>The user is totally imperceptible, and as such can in no way be detected or, in some cases, communicated with by external forces, whether physical, mental, spiritual, technological, etc. As such, they canâ€™t be perceived more potentially even interacted with through smell, touch, vision, hearing, etc. and give off no heat, auras or energy, leaving no evidence of their presence, yet the space they occupy has no lack of it. To all senses, the user does not exist.
