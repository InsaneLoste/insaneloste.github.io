<p>User can delay any future events that have yet to happen, causing them to happen in a later time. With this power, one could make an event that is going to happen to others or to oneself that they do not want to happen yet to be delayed to a later time. It can even affect something's speed in order to make it so it arrives later than planned. They cannot stop the event from happening, though.
