<p>Users can discern the past and past events using various means, usually entering a trance while seeing and hearing a noted past event, whether it be concerning themselves or of an unfamiliar lineage in a past occurrence. The user can recall any event that happened in the past, even obscure, intricate events. Occasionally spontaneous. This ability shows who did what at that particular time; similar to the psionic/extrasensory ability of Clairvoyance but only seeing anything from the past, despite not being there.
