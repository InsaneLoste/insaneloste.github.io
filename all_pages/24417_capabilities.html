The term superorganism is used most often to describe a social unit of eusocial animals, where division of labor is highly specialized, and individuals are not able to survive by themselves for extended periods. A superorganism can be defined as "a collection of agents which can act in concert to produce phenomena governed by the collective", phenomena being any activity "the hive wants" such as ants collecting food and avoiding predators, or bees choosing a new nest site.
