<p>The user can control the flow of electric charge through a gas, liquid or solid and other matters. Properties and effects of electric discharges are useful over a wide range of magnitudes. Tiny pulses of current are used to detect ionizing radiation. The user can release large quantities of electrical energies in radius wise to cause massive damage. The user can also formulate a current as to how the electrical energy flows and guide it as to where the user desires.
