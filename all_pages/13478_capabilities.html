<p>Users of this ability can either take on the traits of, or are a Kawahime, a type of water-dwelling monster in Japanese folklore that was believed to haunt water (especially near bridges and watermills), appearing as beautiful women they would seduce men and then feed on their life-force.
While almost exclusively beautiful women some accounts also gave Kawahime kappa-like appearances, this could be due to Kawahime shapeshifting or mistaken identity (as kappa, like many yokai, can also change shape).
