<p>User can shape and manipulate the stage of reality, letting them control it like a play on a stage/theater. This allows them to assign roles/purposes, narrate what will and when it will happen, change the plot and/or the background, etc. Some users can even change the very nature of anyone/anything by changing their role or destiny in the grand stage of things.
