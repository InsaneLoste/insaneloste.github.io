<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate elements of an ancient primordial nature, elements so ancient that they were from the beginning of the universe. As opposed to regular Elemental Manipulation, users of this ability are <i>mostly</i> deities, avatars, or living embodiment of the elements themselves but there can be exceptions. Being more powerful than ordinary element manipulation, one can use this power for a variety of powerful and catastrophic effects. Such as altering the very concept of the elements, change how the elements interact with the world, and perform planetary or even cosmic level feats with ease. In many cases, users of this power will be able to override any other forms of Elemental Manipulation as the elements themselves comprise the domain of the user. Due to the raw potency and primeval nature of this power, it enables the user to easily overpower immunities to elemental abilities.
