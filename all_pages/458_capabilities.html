<p>User can create, shape and manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Activation_energy" title="wikipedia:Activation energy">activation energy</a>, the minimum amount of energy needed to initiate a specific reaction. These can range from chemical reactions (energy needed to alter the chemical nature of substances) to nuclear reactions (energy needed to initiate events like fission or fusion). Some substances will react due to their proximity, thus having a zero value for activation energy; other materials will only react after a specific amount of energy is added to the mix. Whatever the event, energy will be produced from it, but only after initial energy is provided in most cases.
