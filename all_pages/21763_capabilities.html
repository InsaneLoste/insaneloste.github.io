<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Sarugami or are one. A sarugami is an exceptionally clever and dangerous monkey that gains human level intelligence as well as yokai powers, such as the ability to speak and carry weapons. Often acting as villains, they will raid villages and kidnap women as well as steal and generally cause disruption before retreating back to the mountains. It is thus the job of brave samurai to hunt these creatures down and slay them in order to bring peace to the regions.
