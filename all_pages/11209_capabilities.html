<p>Users either are or can transform into the extraterrestrial being known as the greys typically depicted as gray-skinned (sometimes muted blue or green, occasionally a beige). The modern version of the Little Green Men and currently the most common depiction of extraterrestrials. They have the same basic body plan as humans, but they're grey, somewhat shorter than an average adult human, and have enormous heads with equally huge black eyes resembling an upside-down-raindrop. They probably have no nose (when they do, the nostrils are thin like reptiles), and they almost certainly wear no clothes (though they will have no visible genitals). In the older stories, they sometimes got silver spacesuits. Sometimes they will be a muted blue or green instead, and very occasionally a beige variant. Like the Little Green Men before them, they still tend to come in spacecraft. However, the overtly hostile version is much rarer; abduction is their primary modus operandi (which naturally may be taken as still fairly sinister, of course). They will not speak in beeping noises, though, and they certainly don't know English. Mostly they will not speak at all. They may be telepathic alongside having other alien-like powers. What they do with those abducted varies but performing experiments and even the creation of Half-Human Hybrids.
