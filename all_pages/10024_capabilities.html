<p>The user can take the face and/or skin of their intended target by pressing it to their own face/body they may wear it like a mask perfectly blending in with the rest of their flesh to appear like the said target through molding or other means. The body normally will adjust to compensate the stolen face to take on the full appearance of the victim or they wear their entire skin and allow it to tighten to assume the target's identity. Though blending in the face can be removed or peeled off returning the user to their natural appearance. Many users preserve multiple faces and carry them like masks in order to change appearance at will.
