<p>The charager is a Transcendent Giant Mage, a Giant Mage whose mastery over magic puts them on par with (or sometimes even above) the gods or other equally powerful beings - while many of them have mastered unthinkable cosmic power it is possible for some of them to be slightly more limited (for example Mimir's status is largely due to his omniscience, which surpassed even the gods themselves).
