<p>The user can transform into different elements (fire, water, air, etc.) to achieve a form of intangibility, allowing attacks to either pass right through their elemental bodies or be harmlessly absorbed into their bodies, depending on the user's element. This also can allow them to phase through solid objects that do not obstruct the element the user mimics.
