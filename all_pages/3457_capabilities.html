<p>The user is made up of or can transform their body completely into bread, including (but not limited to) pita, sourdough, bagels, biscuits, crackers, etc. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of bread and grain-related ingredients, in which case, it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks.
