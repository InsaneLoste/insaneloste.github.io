<p>User can share space with other matter or make other things share space with other things. They can cause things to be able to be contained in other objects or use this to ignore attacks. They can even interact inside the object they share space with, allowing them to destroy, rupture or rearrange the insides of those objects. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Intangibility" title="Intangibility">Intangibility</a>, the user is still tangible, and can be touched by anything else except the matter/object they are sharing space with.
