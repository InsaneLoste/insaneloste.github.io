<p>User can observe/view/watch absolutely everything, everywhere, everywhen, and everyhow at the exact same time and regardless of where or when it is or might be. They can view realities outside of the whole of existence, into dimensions shielding against every form of observation, see the lives and connections that tie together anything/everything and the thoughts and dreams of every creature/entity/demon/god or eldritch horror that exists or doesn't exist. They can view out into the boundless emptiness and nonexistence where <a href="/wiki/Isolation" title="Isolation">isolated</a> and <a href="/wiki/Omnilock" title="Omnilock">locked</a> entities dwell.
