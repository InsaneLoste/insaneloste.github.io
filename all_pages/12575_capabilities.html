<p>The user can manipulate the forces of impacts and collisions and make objects come to a dead stop after hitting something, or bounce back from hitting something. They can also cause objects to move and push things they hit if they have large mass and also control the amount of deformation, heat and sound that occurs in a collision, or even use this to cause objects to tear through walls. With enough training, the user can turn their surrounding environment into a pinball machine-like environment.
