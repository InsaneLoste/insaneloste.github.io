<p>The bards were held in high esteem in ancient European cultures due to their affinity with words, creating oral poems and dealing with words. This ability was normally reserved by holy men and sages, because words were considered (even today) as one of the most powerful mediums for magical powers: While regular magicians could conjure curses, bards were specialized in humiliating their foes to the point that they were hated and despised for years, sometimes for all ofÂ eternity if the verses were immortalized. In later times, however, the role of the bard was confused with that of minstrels, and both eventually mixed and melded until they became indistinguishable.
