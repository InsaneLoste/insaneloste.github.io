<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_phenomena" title="wikipedia:Transport phenomena">transport phenomena</a>, occurrences involving the movement of energy, mass and/or momentum within a particular system. These are particularly special as they can be considered ubiquitous. The size of the system can range from the microscopic to potentially planet-wide environments. The movement of molecules creates unique events carrying substances/power to new locations. They tend to fall into three categories: 1) Fluid mechanics, the nature of fluids (gases and liquids) whether at rest or in motion, usually involving the force of momentum acting on them, 2) Heat transferal, the flow of heat (thermal energy) within a system by way of conduction (transfer of heat from an area of high temperature to an area of low temperature), convection (transfer of heat through a fluid by current movement), radiation (transfer of heat by electromagnetic waves) and changes in matter phase (e.g., evaporation) and 3) Mass transfer, the movement of mass from one location to another by processes like distillation, drying and absorption.
