<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate reaching. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Distance_Manipulation" title="Distance Manipulation">Distance Manipulation</a>, which reduces or extends the gap or distance between things, this power can be used to make things reachable or unreachable without actually altering the actual distance between the two objects, such as reaching and grabbing an object miles away without even moving or altering the actual distance. If something is reached and pulled to the user, that something skips distance and goes into the user's hand.
