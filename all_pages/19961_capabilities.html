<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate darkness of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Darkness Manipulation, users of this power are often deities, avatars, or living embodiment of darkness, in many cases able to override other forms of Darkness Manipulation as darkness is the domain of the user. Due to its primordial nature, it goes beyond concepts of good, evil, and even neutrality. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunities &amp; resistances to dark-based abilities.
