<p>User is immune to fire, being completely invulnerable to direct and indirect effects. Essentially, the user simply cannot be burned to death, being able to walk through a burning building, with merely debris and smoke inhalation to worry about. Remarkably, the user could withstand oven or microwave-level temperatures, heat that would usually cause severe skin damage. Since fire naturally spreads, the user could become a living candle. Though they'd have to be very careful, not to torch everyone/everything else around them.
