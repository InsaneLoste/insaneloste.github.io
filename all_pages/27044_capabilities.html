<p>The user distorts the space around a target turning it into a warp field and collapsing matter within the field through a spatial distortion into a dimensional void, instantly teleporting the target to another location. The exiting warp points can also appear within solid matter, allowing one to teleport objects into another object. Powerful users can link these warps through space, time, and alternate dimensions, allowing travel anywhere.
