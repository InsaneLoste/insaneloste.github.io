<p>The user can defy their plane of rotation, allowing them to perform normally impossible maneuvers in rotation. For example, instead of acting like it is flat, they can act like the plane of rotation is bent, angled, altered, etc. and thus, do things like do half a spin on a half-flat plane of rotation and then change orientation and finish the spin while the other half of the plane is at right angles to the other half, plus mote.
