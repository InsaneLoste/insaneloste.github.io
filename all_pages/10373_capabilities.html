<p>The user can negate friction for themselves and/or others (including objects/beings/surfaces), the force that resists motion (unlike inertia, which is not a force and resists change in motion, friction does not resist the change, just motion by itself), which allows them to run on, hold onto, or move on any surface, regardless of how slippery or even rough and movement dampening/sticky the friction is. This allows them to run on surfaces like ice without falling down, and move at high speed, even when running on surfaces of high friction that would otherwise slow them down.
