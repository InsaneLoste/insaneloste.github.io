<p>The user can utilize the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_magic" title="wikipedia:White magic">White Arts</a>, a benevolent system of techniques based around a purer side of magic that is typically used for unselfish, self-sacrificing and/or noble purposes. Practitioners of this type of magic tend to focus toward assisting others, purifying evil spirits, dispelling curses, creating medical potions and respecting all the rules about what is forbidden and not. They are also capable of using offensive magic, though this comes with strict restrictions most of the time.
