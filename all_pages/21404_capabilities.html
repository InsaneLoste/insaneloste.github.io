<p>The user understands the properties of objects recoiling off of surface and how to create ricochets. They do this through a combination of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Physics_Intuition" title="Physics Intuition">Physics Intuition</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Geometry_Intuition" title="Geometry Intuition">Geometry Intuition</a> or by <a href="/wiki/Recoil_Proficiency" title="Recoil Proficiency">Recoil Proficiency</a>. They must consider the mass, shape, and properties of the object they are throwing. They must also consider the force they put into the throw. This allows them to ricochet an object back to the user or cause chain attacks on multiple targets. They can also indirectly hit their target or perform trick shots.
