<p>Users can empower their existing abilities to higher levels, certain users can even augment their powers to their highest/absolute level. Increasing their powers could also change the color/shade/shape/feel of their powers. (Note although the user can Amplify/Augment their Abilities/Powers they can still use a weakened Ability/Power and still can actually use their Powers/Abilities at any level from minimum to maximum.)
