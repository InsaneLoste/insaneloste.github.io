Much like the rest of the empowered ghosts, meta ghosts are much stronger than regular ghosts all thanks to having superpowers, and they tend to be more difficult to dispatch, at least depending on what powers they possess, whether they almost dwarf the power of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Ghost_Lord_Physiology" title="Ghost Lord Physiology">ghost lord</a> or not. They can also be much more intelligent than their regular predecessors, at least depending on their power sets. A living person can become a superpowered ghost depending on how the circumstances of their deaths, such as someone dying in a blizzard gaining ice and snow-based abilities.
