<p>The user can manipulate how things are in other points of time, other timelines, etc. They can merge places in different points of time together into one, affect if target can survive in that place or not, conditions and (if any) different physical laws. They can make target gain new skills, powers, knowledge etc. as they enters a past or future time, for example, entering past point in time, their existence changes as if they have always been a part of the time/timeline, possibly changing history, especially if the user goes to the past.
