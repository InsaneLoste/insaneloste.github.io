<li>It is possible, but unlikely, that the quick movements and the quick stops put a strain on the user's body, breaking bones, destroying internal organs, or the air pushing against their chest could cause respiratory arrest. The speed moving could theoretically flay both skin and muscle from the bone.</li></ul>
