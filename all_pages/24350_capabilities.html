<p>Users have glaringly, obviously and super/unnaturally greater precision than other beings in their universe because their capabilities are pushed beyond the natural level, making them able to slice, cut, stab, etc. much better than regular beings (in that verse).  Users are capable of feats of precision that are way beyond mortal comprehension and capabilities. Users are capable of hitting targets moving at insane speeds, like hitting someone moving faster than light. They never lose their concentration or their target, allowing them to always hit them with 100% precision and lethality.
