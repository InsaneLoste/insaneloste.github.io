<p>The user can manipulate the <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Recoil" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">recoil</a>, the practical result of Newton's Third Law that each force has an equal, opposite force that occurs at the same time. Guns and springs are examples of recoiling objects, as well as kicking off the boat when jumping to the docks or even punches (though they may be small). The user can manipulate how strong the recoil is and how fast one can be sent flying when the recoil happens. This could make it so that a person, after punching, will be sent flying backward a long distance, or make it so a gun and spring do not recoil much, or at all. The user also can control how fast recoiling happens and how fast a person may be sent flying backward if they make the recoil strong enough.
