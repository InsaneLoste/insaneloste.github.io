<p>The user can move or act while using illusions to hide their real actions before the opponent realizes that they are actually doing something else. The user could be looking like they are doing one thing, with an illusion to show that, and actually do their real action the next moment or be doing it in the meantime. The real user may be invisible while doing this.
