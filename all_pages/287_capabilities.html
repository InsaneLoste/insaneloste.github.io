<p>Users have all their capabilities, attributes and aspects at a maximum and limitless level. At the most basic level, users have a supreme and absolute physical and mental condition, with absolutely nothing being able to surpass them in those attributes. For example, with their strength, they could lift multiverses or punch so hard reality is distorted. With their speed, they could travel infinite distances/execute infinite actions within a finite amount of time and go everywhere and everywhen faster than instantly. With their intellect, they could outsmart the smartest cosmic beings effortlessly. With their defense, they could be hit by an explosion from 100 gas giants or 100 multiverses and not get a scratch or even feel pain.
