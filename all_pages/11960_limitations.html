<li>Users of <a href="/wiki/Force-Field_Generation" title="Force-Field Generation">Force-Field Generation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Intangibility" title="Intangibility">Intangibility</a> can defend themselves and avoid the homing projectiles, though they must keep such defenses active at all times as long as the projectiles are still active.</li>
<li>People with <a href="/wiki/Probability_Manipulation" title="Probability Manipulation">Probability Manipulation</a> can use their power to dodge the projectiles by 'pure luck'.</li>
<li>Destruction of projectiles will stop them from hitting, including causing two of such projectiles to hit each other.</li>
<li>Must at least take the initial aim at the target (cannot just fire in some random direction and expect the projectile to automatically home in on the target, unlike targeting), meaning the user's first aim is still as crucial as any normal shot.</li></ul>
