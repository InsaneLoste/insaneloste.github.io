In other words, the part of the mind that considers others over the individual. In Sigmund Freud's theory, the Id (one's deepest, unfiltered desires) and the Superego insert suggestions to the Ego (one's own sense of identity). While the Id tries to convince theÂ ego to act upon their desires, the Superego demands for them to do the right thing. Because of this, the Superego is seen as the most honorable and righteous path to take.
