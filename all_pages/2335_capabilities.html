<p>The user has a destructive form of <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" title="Telekinesis">telekinesis</a>. The user can only discharge savage, turbulent, or discord-inducing applications of telekinesis (telekinetic explosions, bombs, blasts, repulsion, crushing, etc.), being incapable of more "delicate" uses. The user can produce telekinetic outbursts that can damage buildings, telekinetically cut targets, or generate a telekinetic nuclear detonation. The magnitude of their telekinetic power differs from carrying out destructive telekinetic features on a neighborhood, metropolitan areas, continental, planetary, stellar, or galactic level.
