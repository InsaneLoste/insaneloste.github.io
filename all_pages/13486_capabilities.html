<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kelpie" title="wikipedia:Kelpie">Kelpie</a>, a shape-shifting water spirit inhabiting the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Loch" title="wikipedia:Loch">lochs</a> and pools of Scotland. It appears as a horse, but is able to adopt human form, possibly retaining its hooves when appearing as a human. As a horse, it's appearance varies greatly, it is usually described as a powerful and beautiful black horse inhabiting the deep pools, rivers and streams of Scotland, preying on any humans it encounters. One of the water-kelpie's common identifying characteristics is that its hooves are reversed as compared to those of a normal horse. An Aberdeenshire variation is a horse with a mane of serpents, whereas the resident equine spirit of the River Spey is white and could entice victims onto its back by singing.
