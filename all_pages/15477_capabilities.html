<p>User can control the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Butterfly_effect" title="wikipedia:Butterfly effect">butterfly effect</a>, i.e. all the different causes and their reaction that can have a huge net effect on the whole system. All the causes may be small and completely unrelated to each other in both space and time, yet they can cause many big things in the flow of time which no one can predict. Notable example: a butterfly flapping its wings can cause a hurricane several weeks after.
