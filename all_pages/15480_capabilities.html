<p>Users can create absolutely everything/anything without limits, including concepts, existence, reality, and even the totality itself. They can also create from nothing or even create one thing from another, e.g., manifesting an image from a comic book, creating life from the dead, and duplicating anything. The user can create basically anything they choose on an unlimited scale.
