<p>The user can manipulate the afterlife, an existence or region of reality where the individual's identity or stream of consciousness continues beyond the death of their physical body. Many interpretations and existential planes attribute to the afterlife, from commonly Abrahamic religions (heaven, hell, purgatory, etc.) or planes of existence standard throughout polytheistic cultures. The user can control planes of existence themselves, from transmuting a utopia-environment to a hellish landscape full of eternal burning and torment or combining multiple planes to construct a fused-megastructure of composite afterlives, full of different gods, divine entities, demonic creatures, spirits, powers, and knowledge.
