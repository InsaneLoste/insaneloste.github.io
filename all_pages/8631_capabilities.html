<p>The user has enhanced stability capabilities. This means the user has the ability to move well even if their body is in positions that are not supposed to allow the user to stay upright. This is useful when the user has enhanced flexibility, is elastic, or has multiple joints, making it so that they can move and stay stable and upright even if they are not supposed to while in any position. For example, if the user's legs are boneless/elastic or has too many joints to supposedly keep upright, the user of this power can ignore the drawbacks of having such characteristics and stay upright anyway.
