<p>The user is either made up of or can transform their body completely into jigsaw. A user's transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of jigsaw, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
