It is characterized by the 4 basic ranges of combat: Kicking, Punching, Trapping, and Grappling. However, an important part of Jeet Kune Do is one where one mustn't be rigid and must instead being fluid and instantly adapt no matter what situation one happens to be in, whether in combat or everyday life. It is also the liberation from styles, patterns, and molds, instead using what is useful, while abandoning what isn't, making it a "style without style". A user is meant to act with no wasted time or movements, believing in <a href="/wiki/Disproportionate_Force" title="Disproportionate Force">minimal movement, with maximum effect and extreme speed</a>, thus "Expressing The Human Body".
