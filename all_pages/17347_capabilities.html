<p>User possesses all movement capabilities. They can perform all capabilities of motion within the universe no matter what, whether it be physical, non-physical, spiritual, mental, mystical, abstract/conceptual, etc. Their movements are unresisted, cooperative, easy, fluid, non-crooked, fast, balanced, flawless, responsive, unpredictable, hard to change, etc. to the extreme. The user also can do these movements even if the laws of physics and logic are different in another dimension or altered, and they can interact with imaginary, nonexistent things, too. If the user is converted or changed into anything other than the physical, such as the spiritual, the user can break or defy the movement capabilities of whatever they are made up of. The user can also interact with anything from other dimensions/universes without leaving their own.
