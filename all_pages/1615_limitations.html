<li>Weapon may require a source of power such as an item.</li>
<li>An apocalyptic event may not wipe out all life, it merely has to cause a collapse of most society on a planet / realm - it is possible for new civilizations to return to these realms after the apocalyptic event (unless the world or realm is completely erased).</li>
<li>Advanced use of time-travel, reality-alteration or other nigh-omnipotent powers can undo an apocalyptic event and may even render such items useless (or in the case of exceptionally potent cases erase knowledge of the weapon entirely, meaning it can never be used in the first place).</li></ul>
