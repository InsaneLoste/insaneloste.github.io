<p>The user can transform into beasts, as well as use the abilities, traits and appearance/physiology of beasts by rearranging their own DNA structure. Users may be able to transform into beasts they have never encountered. Some may have this ability from an empty genetic code, allowing them to accept any form from which they have a DNA sample, others may be able to alter their form mentally and change just by seeing and mimicking beastly features.
