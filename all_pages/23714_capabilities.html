<p>The user can manipulate the concept of stage/scenario and is capable of manipulating the stage/scenario of all things. One can manipulate any and all types of scenarios, which are always all "Possibilities or perspectives of an event or situation" and the "Set of circumstances that are considered the environment of a person or event" and not just as the "Place where an action or an event takes place" (as many think) encompassing absolutely anything and everything, making them capable of changing, molding, reshaping, creating, destroying, erasing, bestowing, banishing, manipulating, etc., anything and everything without limits of any kind, making the user essentially all-powerful. Although the user can transcend everything and have power over everything through stage control of the setting, they are not necessarily the origin of everything.
