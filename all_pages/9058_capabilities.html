<p>User can empty/remove the essence, the fundamental traits, qualities and attributes that makes someone who they are, of oneself or others. This removes everything that makes target who they are, including their emotions, senses, memories, thoughts, heart/soul, consciousness/personality, identity, etc. This leaves the target as virtually nothing more than an empty shell, though they still remain alive in a sense as they have a pulse and are capable of breathing and moving.
