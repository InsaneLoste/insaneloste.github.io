<p>Users either are or can transform into living toy or toys. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of toys, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other. Many toys can modify their bodies as needed.
