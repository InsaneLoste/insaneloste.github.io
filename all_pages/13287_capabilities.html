<p>The user can move on oddly shaped and differently sized surfaces that others have a hard time getting through. For example, if a surface is made of triangles or pyramids in terms of shape or is just pointy and crooked, the user can walk on them with no problem. The user can also walk on surfaces of varying sizes and heights, each higher or lower than the last part of the surface.
