<p>The user is able to project words, letters (from any alphabet system), numbers or other forms of symbols for various purposes. While primarily used to cause damage in the form of <a href="/wiki/Ammunition_Generation" title="Ammunition Generation">projectiles</a>, these projected symbols can have other <a href="/wiki/Effect_Generation" title="Effect Generation">effects</a>. For example, in the case of numbers, multiply the effect of a power used in conjunction to this power (like <a href="/wiki/Time_Manipulation" title="Time Manipulation">controlling time</a> and <a href="/wiki/Healing" title="Healing">repairing damage</a>, for example) for greater effect or damage. For words, the user could hit opponents with words, giving an effect or damage that has a great or low magnitude, depending on the given situation. For letters, the user can shoot out letters one at a time, and if each letter consecutively hits the target and spells out a word, the effect or damage could be great.
