<p>Users are immune to electricity, being completely invulnerable to direct and indirect effects. The user simply cannot be paralyzed through electrical elements. They can touch electrical outlets, and not be fatally shocked to death. Lightning could shock them, yet it would be nothing more than a tickle to them. Since they'd be as immune to electricity as pure rubber. Users could even use electrical equipment in or around water, and not worry about being electrocuted.
