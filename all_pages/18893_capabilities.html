<p>The user can ignore the properties of photons, or any massless particle that instantly goes at the speed of light. With this power, the user can be at any speed, even though they are not supposed to as they always should be at the speed of light, as well as ignore other relativistic properties of being massless or photonic such as not accelerating or decelerating from lightspeed, among other things.
