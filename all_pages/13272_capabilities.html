<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="external text" href="http://yokai.com/ippondatara/" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ippon Datara</a> (one-legged bellows), one-legged mountain spirit with appearance of either human-like or a huge pillar. Regardless they have a single eye on like a Cyclops, a massive body and only one leg. Normally they don't show themselves to humans and let only their presence be felt, but at certain times they may become aggressive.
