<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate extra-dimensional elements, which originate from different dimensional realms from either <a href="/wiki/Energylock_Manipulation" title="Energylock Manipulation">outside of our universe</a> or from <a href="/wiki/Pocket_Dimension_Manipulation" title="Pocket Dimension Manipulation">pocket universes</a> hidden within our own. Their foreign natures can allow for unique effects unavailable to the user by their own native dimensional elements, such as usage in various offensive and defensive styles.
