<p>The user can create and project bolts of snow and control the intensity/power of their projectiles, the bolts aren't weak but they aren't as powerful as a <a href="/wiki/Ice_Blast" title="Ice Blast">full-powered</a> attack. These bolts could be used to stun, freeze, injure, or even to possibly penetrate/stab the enemy.
