<p>Users exist outside of magic, and as such are completely unaffected by magic in all its myriads ways, shapes and forms. They don't <a href="/wiki/Meta_Magic" title="Meta Magic">transcend</a> magic but exist independently from it like some entities exist independently from physics. As such, user is completely immune to any magical and magic-altering phenomena.
