<p>The user can adapt to frame inertial forces that occur when an object accelerates (changes speed or direction), such as centrifugal forces, making them resistant/immune to the effects. They can effectively be still or have no trouble moving, even if the object they are on/in is moving, which would cause them to "move backward" (accelerating), "move forward" (decelerating) or sideways (change in direction).
