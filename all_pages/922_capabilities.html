<p>The user can create/generate alkahest, whether by drawing from already existing sources or by manifesting it from anywhere they want. Alkahest is a liquid solvent that not only easily dissolves material yet never affecting the physical properties in one bit. And in a way you can affect the original form of the material without leaving much of a trace other than a deformed shape.
