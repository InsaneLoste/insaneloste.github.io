<ul><li>Though they can't be hurt by sunlight, Nelapši can't be awake at day and must return to their graves before dawn.</li>
<li>Nelapši can be killed by penetrating the heart/skull with a stake followed by decapitation, surrounding the body with garlic, and either reburying or burning the body. This is usually performed during the day when the creature's asleep.</li>
<li>Attacks of Nelapši can be prevented by sowing the opium poppy on the grave. Nelapši will be distracted and count seeds all night, forced to return to their grave without feeding.</li></ul>
