<ul><li>Users cannot return to being normal beings with specific features that stand out and may cause others to fear them.</li>

<li>Depending on the setting or the method of mutation, a user can become deadly to others due to constantly emitting lethal doses of radiation (which they are immune to); this can be especially dangerous as many users are unaware of how deadly they are until someone nearby perishes.</li>
<li>Not all radiation works the same. Thus often, a user will react differently depending on what type of radiation they are exposed to, with some radiation types diminishing their power, removing it entirely, or even giving them a Secondary Mutation.</li></ul>
