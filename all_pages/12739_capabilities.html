<p>User can make targets (whether living or objects) that they touch inertialess, and extremely easy to move around, allowing for many strength-based feats. The target is inertialess relative to themselves while they still have inertia to everyone and everything else. They can even throw such things very fast and cause big damage with heavy objects as they leave the user's hand.
