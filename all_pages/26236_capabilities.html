<p>The user either is or can become an undead machine, a corpse or machine wreck that is dead/destroyed, but still animated (and has cybernetic components added on them for the corpse). Thanks to being undead as well, they have a lot of immunities and probably lost some of their physical weaknesses. Usually, the user is created into this form by being dead, and reanimated by special terms, specifically technology.
