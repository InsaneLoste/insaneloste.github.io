<p>The user can create or wield weapons, such as blades, polearms, or whips, with power over the <a href="/wiki/Nothingness_Manipulation" title="Nothingness Manipulation">void</a>, which grants the user a wide variety of nothingness-based abilities. This ability is not only specific to mystic weapons, but also technologically advanced weapons. The power of the weapons depends on what they were created for or what level of void-based ability they posses.
