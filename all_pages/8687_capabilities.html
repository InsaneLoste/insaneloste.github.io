<p>The user can create or use a weapon or an arsenal of weapons imbued with supernatural powers and properties, the weapon can be bestow/endowed with its own unique powers or the user can use it to channel their power into it and even act as an augmentation device. These weapons are so powerful that normal weapons pale in compassion, some of which are sentient and pick their own wielders. Due to the supernatural qualities that the weapon inherits, their capabilities and abilities can have an enigmatic nature thatâ€™s difficult to understand due to their powers deriving from supernatural forces/energies. Not only can users manipulate the otherworldly forces that comes from their weapon and/or enables its powers, they can also gain a supernatural status that allows them to supernaturally enhance their natural abilities and to walk within various supernatural planes of existence that no normal person can get, too.
