<p>The user has the power to not only feign damage, but fake the movement that they go through when they are hit with strong blows. With this power, the user can pretend that any hit they take, while it doesn't hurt them, seem to affect them as they move themselves across the area to look like they were hit. Even hitting a wall they fly into will not hurt them. This can be good for making others look like they are winning and build up false confidence. Even if they are on the ground and not flying when hit, they can react and move as if they were hit and be knocked back a little as if they were reacting to the hit that supposedly hurt them.
