<p>The user can perceive and read the souls, whether free (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Spirit_Physiology" title="Spirit Physiology">dead</a>, <a href="/wiki/Astral_Projection" title="Astral Projection">astral projection</a>, etc) or in body. They can study and observe the nature of one's soul and find weaknesses based on the nature of the observed souls. By reading souls, the user can see/feel the being's characteristics, personality, feelings, memories, whether they even have a soul, damage others' souls have endured, and whether or not another entity is possessing or influencing the person on a spiritual level.
