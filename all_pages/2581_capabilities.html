<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bhoot_(ghost)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Bhuta</a>, a spirit of the deceased from Hindu origins that torments living by following them home from their graves from cemeteries. They love to haunt cremation grounds along with other monsters like pishachas and vetālas. Bhutas were originally human spirits with unfinished business or who were not buried properly; however, they can become twisted and cruel the longer they are on the plane of the living, to which they become a form of a <a href="/wiki/Demon_Physiology" title="Demon Physiology">malevolent ghost/poltergeist</a> that can lash out, harm or even kill others.
