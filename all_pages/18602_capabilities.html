<p>The user possesses their own, personalized object(s) that are designed or chosen specifically for the user; they can be made of normal or supernatural materials. Because these objects are tailored to user, they can't be stolen, lost, sold; they just re-materialize back to the user. The user can materialize their objects whenever they need to and can even swap between different types of objects to fit the situation.
