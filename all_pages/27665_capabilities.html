<p>Users of this ability can take on the traits of a Wulver (or are one), a benevolent type of fairy from Scottish folklore (specifically the Shetland Isles) that resembles a humanoid wolf. They reside in caves atop hills and frequently fish. When left alone, they are peaceful creatures that will even leave behind gifts of fish at the windows of people in need, but if provoked, could attack humans, though they only did so to protect themselves.
