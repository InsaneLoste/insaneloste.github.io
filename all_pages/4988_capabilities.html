<p>Users embody conquest, being the physical representation of subjugation and domination. Being the literal embodiment of conquest, users would be able to effortlessly conquer anything or anyone, immediately seizing dominion of whatever they wish through absolutely any means necessary. Most of the time, users would already be in extremely high positions of power or authority through having conquered nearly everything. Truer embodiments would be able to conquer nonphysical things such as concepts or thoughts, essentially enabling users to manipulate and control them.
