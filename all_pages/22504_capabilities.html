<p>The user can move, attack, act and even think without interruption, meaning that when they act, think or move, they act and move instantly, and when they end a movement, thought or action, they start another action instantaneously at the same time the previous action, thought or movement ended. This allows good flow of movement, and makes it hard for others to tell if the user has stopped or paused when acting, thinking or moving.
