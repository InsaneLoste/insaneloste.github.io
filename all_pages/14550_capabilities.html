<p>User can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lunar_soil" title="wikipedia:Lunar soil">lunar dust</a>, which is electrically charged, tends to stick to things it comes in contact with. It is abrasive, meaning it cuts through things, jagged, and dangerous to breathe in, corrosive, gritty, more chemically reactive than Earth dust and can have an effect on electrical systems. Unlike the dust, or soil of Earth, it is non organic.
