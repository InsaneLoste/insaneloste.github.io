<p>The user can manipulate a confined and energetic variation of <a href="/wiki/Dream_Manipulation" title="Dream Manipulation">dream manipulation</a>. The difference between dream manipulation and dream force manipulation is the range of applications. Dream manipulation focuses on precision and power, while dream force focuses on pure raw might. Dream manipulation is more cultivated and can efficiently perform complicated applications such as manipulating the dreamworld or interacting with thousands of subjects with complex manipulation without distress; however, dream force manipulation cannot gain precision due to being programmed with sheer strength. Sometimes, dream force manipulation can unintentionally gain mastered-level techniques of basic applications due to the user possessing raw might. Because of this, users are unable to manipulate the concept of dreams or manipulate the states of consciousness associated with dreaming, confined to basic-advanced techniques but can serve them with overwhelming power.
