<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of an Ogama or are one. Ogama are frogs or toads who have lived long enough to be transformed into yokai, thus they gain humanoid intelligence and size as well as a host of magical abilities such as a rainbow-breath that can trap prey, spears by which to attack humans if needed, shape-shifting abilities and a fearsome adaptation of their natural ability to snatch and devour things with their long, sticky tongues.
