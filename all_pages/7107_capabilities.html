<p>Users have the power to be the embodiment of dreams and have complete control of their dreams and the dreams of others. They can attack or protect others in dreams as well as affecting the real world to some degree via dreams or daydreams. Users may have little to no power in the real world but can still affect the dreams of others even if they themselves are not asleep. Users gain power from dreams and can live on in dreams if they are killed in the real world.
