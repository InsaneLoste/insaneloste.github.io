<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a Ch≈çchin-bi (Lit. lantern fire), a yokai in the form of a floating ball of fire. It is said that they appear in footpaths between rice fields and will disappear once humans get close to them.  They are named as such due paper lanterns being lit by monsters like Kitsune or Tanuki, also called "Tanukibi" (Lit. tanuki fire).
