<p>Telekinesis (from Greek: τηλε- "far off" and κίνηση "movement") is the ability to influence/control/manipulate matter or another aspect of a physical system with the ‘mind’ or through other non-physical means. Commonly, the most fundamental trait is to move or otherwise interact with objects (or to generate and apply physical force on a target, or potentially, an area) both from a distance and without physical contact.
