<p>User can cause others to become discouraged in the face of the user regardless of the intentions, interests, ability, etc., of the target. Often the target will simply surrender, freeze or run away.  This allows the user to control the fear and actions of others on a scale from a single individual to enormous hordes of enemies, preventing them from doing anything else but run from the user. This is usually done by actions, such as attacking, showing off one's moves, making gestures of a specific kind or making a fearful sound.
