<p>User can recall/remember all of ones lives, both possible and impossible ones. This allows them to not only remember and be aware of past lives, but each and every one of their lives, including future ones, alternate/parallel ones, nonexistent/impossible/abstract ones, dream versions, erased ones, sealed ones, versions that never actually happened, illusionary versions, shared versions, temporal resurrected/looped versions, etc.
