<p>The user can create, shape, or manipulate elements outside of the regular sphere of magical elements, like the Godai (Earth, Fire, Water, Wind, Void/Aether) and the Wu Xing (Wood, Earth, Water, Fire, and Metal) or elements outside the reality or the laws of physics also but not limited to any type of element the user can imagine. For example, Water with Magma properties or Fire with Wind properties or Mana. Imaginary elements are not recognized by any system. It's possible to use magic based on these imaginary elements or to create constructs using them.
