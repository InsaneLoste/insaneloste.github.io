The user may create such a force through <a href="/wiki/Replication" title="Replication">Replication</a> of one or a few individuals, or through <a href="/wiki/Self-Replication" title="Self-Replication">Self-Replication</a>. The large force may or may not be connected through a <a href="/wiki/Hive_Mind" title="Hive Mind">Hive Mind</a>.
