<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sky" title="wikipedia:Sky">sky</a> including all the aspects of the weather and other phenomenon observable and present in the sky. This ability can be used in a similar fashion to <a href="/wiki/Spatial_Manipulation" title="Spatial Manipulation">Spatial Manipulation</a>, where one can distort the atmosphere and reshape it at will, whether it'd be to attack or defend. At a higher level, one would be able to exert control over everything inside the sky, including matter and living things.
