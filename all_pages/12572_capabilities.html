<p>The user can defy impacts, allowing them to bounce off into any direction other than what is specified from Newton's Third Law when hitting something. They can also defy the magnitude of impact, making it so that the user is unaffected by them, and they can make it so that the impact is elastic or inelastic in terms of impact "bounciness". The user can defy the laws of conservation of energy and momentum when dealing with impacts. They can make it so they bounce off walls, stop dead at walls, or break through them when they aren't supposed to.
