<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a wraith, an incorporeal evil spirit from the netherworld - distinct from demons - that drains the life energy of mortals in order to sustain their existence and may be able to steal souls as well. Typically wraiths appear as shadowy forms wrapped in robes or cloaks, or simply vague shadows, but this isn't always the case.
