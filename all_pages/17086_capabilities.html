<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="https://community.fandom.com/wiki/wikipedia:Nuclear_chemistry" title="w:wikipedia:Nuclear chemistry">nuclear chemistry</a>, the chemistry of radioactivity, nuclear processes, and transformations. This is considered a higher, more versatile form of <a href="/wiki/Nuclear_Manipulation" title="Nuclear Manipulation">Nuclear Manipulation</a>. Unlike the former, users who can manipulate nuclear chemistry are able to command more than just nuclear reactions. They can control any nuclear process, its properties, the mechanics behind them, and the relationship matter ultimately has with nuclear power. The user is able to achieve a wide variety of uses with this ability. When mastered, this ultimately allows one to manipulate energy and matter on a subatomic level with nuclear chemical activity.
