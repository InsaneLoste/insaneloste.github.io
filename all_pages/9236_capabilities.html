<p>The user wears a specialized suit of armor by using technology alone. The armor may be powered or manipulated by the user's thoughts, so the user would have to concentrate for the suit to function at full capacity. With such varied mechanical functions, the Exoskeleton may have drawbacks, ranging from manageable, to near-insurmountable. A constant or rechargeable power supply may be required for activation and continual use, otherwise the suit could potentially drain the user's life energy, thus rendering them unconscious, or even dead. The suit may enhance the abilities of those who already have powers or dampen them if external containment is an issue. The suit may also be equipped with all sorts of gadgets the user can call on.
