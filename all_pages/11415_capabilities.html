<p>The character either is or can transform into a destroyer deity, a god/goddess of immense power that can destroy anything and everything, even other divine beings. They can destroy planets, star systems and even universes in an instant. As a Deity of Destruction, the user also has the task of keeping balance in the universe. Working together with <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Creator_Deity" title="Archetype:Creator Deity">creation deities</a>, destroyer deities discuss which planets and/or galaxies need to be destroyed and/or rebuilt. However, they aren't necessarily anti-gods, because their nature is not only evil at all aspects.
