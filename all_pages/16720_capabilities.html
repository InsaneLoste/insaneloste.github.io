<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into needle or needles. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside from being made of needles, in which case it contains all organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
