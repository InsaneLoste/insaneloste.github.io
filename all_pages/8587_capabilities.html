<p>The user has an enhanced form of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proprioception" title="wikipedia:Proprioception">Proprioception</a>.Â Proprioception is one of six senses of the human body. It allows you to be aware of your body position without seeing it. This prevents a person from not being able to move. Without it, a person is forced to be able to see their limb in order to move it. Its primary use is to keep us balanced. A person with an enhanced proprioception is able to tell where their body is better than anyone. This allows for enhanced coordination and to flawlessly keep track of every moving body part. They can perform really complex tasks that involve keeping tabs on every body part and where it's at, such as preventing your arms from hitting each other when fighting really fast. They have a strong sense of balance; they can also tell where to place their body part to carry out a task efficiently. This ability is typically found in characters with an enhanced somatosensory system. If the character is a mech pilot, they have a better sense of where each mech body part is, which allows them to learn how to pilot a mech faster and better.
