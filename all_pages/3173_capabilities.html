<p>The user can control the bluntness in any object they touch, either imbuing or taking the quality of bluntness away: blunt objects can cause damage depending on what it is, while edged surfaces, objects, like knives, can be imbued to be blunt. The user can make it so that sharp objects don't cut, or remove bluntness from things, turning clubs and other edged weapons into any kind of sharp object.
