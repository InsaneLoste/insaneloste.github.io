<p>The user with this ability either is or can mimic/transform into mathematical figures. Users' transformed form can be anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of mathematical figures, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
