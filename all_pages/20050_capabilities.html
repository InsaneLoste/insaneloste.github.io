<p>The user can make the improbable probable, making them more likely than they were before. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Possibility_Inducement" title="Possibility Inducement">Possibility Inducement</a>, which makes the impossible possible, this merely deals with probabilities rather than possibilities, thus cannot affect things such as physical laws that make things impossible. Events will not happen on their own, however, as the user or someone else needs to do something to make things happen.
