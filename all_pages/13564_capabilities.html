<p>The user can ignore kinetic, work and the law of conservation of energy. Kinetic energy is the energy of motion, or half of mass times velocity squared. Work is the measure of energy transfer that occurs when an object is moved over a distance by an external force, and the conservation of energy law states that energy cannot be created or destroyed, only changed in form. They can defy kinetic energy, making the collisions inelastic (not conserving kinetic energy) or elastic (conserving kinetic energy). They can ignore kinetic energy to stop at a short distance, keep kinetic energy without losing any, defy how it is transferred, and exert large amounts of kinetic energy with little force and movement.
