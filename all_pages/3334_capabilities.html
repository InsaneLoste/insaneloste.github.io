<p>The user can remove bones from the target's bodies, from singular bones to whole skeleton, by removing them from the body by shifting them from the body, ripping them out or simply disappearing them. Exact effects depend on how much of the skeleton is removed from where and how: whole skeleton, skull, spine or ribcage is lethal, limb-bones make that limb useless, etc. May be extremely painful.
