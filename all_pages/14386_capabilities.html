<p>User either is, can transform into or has a body that can act as a seal. Whatever the form they act as a living or seemingly living prison or gate to maintain control over an entity, power, object, etc. Many times, their existence is based purely around the purpose of being a seal. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Symbiosis" title="Symbiosis">Symbiosis</a>, they do not necessarily gain any power from containing their target.
