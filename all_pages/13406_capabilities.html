<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jujutsu" title="wikipedia:Jujutsu">jujutsu</a>, a family of Japanese martial arts and a system of close combat (unarmed or with a minor weapon) that can be used in a defensive or offensive manner to kill or subdue one or more weaponless or armed and armored opponents. The core philosophy of jujutsu is to manipulate the opponent's force against them rather than countering it with their own.
