<p>The user can manipulate optionality, which is something that is not required or mandatory to do. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Option_Manipulation" title="Option Manipulation">Option Manipulation</a>, which is about manipulating possible options of something, this just manipulates things that are just not required in the sense that they are not an obligation, and does not really manipulate something that has alternatives, just one thing and if it has to be done or not.
