<p>Users can block pain at will, are incapable of feeling pain or are highly resistant to the physical pain of any kind, allowing them to think clearly and continue to move without even flinching despite horrific and grievous injuries. Users can continue to move, ignore torture and generally function in situations where the pain would disable a normal person. The user does not react at all when damaged, they can walk onward as they are being damaged or continue fighting without stopping no matter how hard they are hit.
