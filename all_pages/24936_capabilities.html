<p>The user can generate and manipulate a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Force_Field_Generation" title="Force Field Generation">barrier or field</a> or any <a href="/wiki/Effect_Field_Projection" title="Effect Field Projection">form of influence</a> controlled and possessing telekinetic characteristics. This specialized form of the user's aura is composed of natural forces (fundamental forces, cosmic energy, entropic energy, etc.) or supernatural means (psionic energy, magical forces, scientific energy, primordial energy, etc.). The user's telekinetic aura is controlled through conscious effort and instinct as if they were parts of their own body. The user's aura can materialize anything in terms of influence, from generating appendages, expanding field that controls anything within it, or binding fields that surround an object to move it.
