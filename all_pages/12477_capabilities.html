<p>The user can pretend to have powers similar to a <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Supreme_Deity" title="Archetype:Supreme Deity">Supreme Being</a>. How this can work in action is creating illusions/hallucinations or acts of trickery, possess abilities that can make it appear cosmic or godlike to prove the lie. This power is below logic so anyone who can detect the truth/logic behind them can see their true form.
