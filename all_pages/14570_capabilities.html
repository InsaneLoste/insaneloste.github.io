<p>The user's mere <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Presence" title="Presence">presence</a> in the area or proximity around them is the same as that of the <a href="/wiki/Lunar_Embodiment" title="Lunar Embodiment">moon</a> as they are producing <a href="/wiki/Lunar_Generation" title="Lunar Generation">lunar energies</a> which effects and changes those surrounding areas just as a moon would. The area around user's inexplicable presence can cause positive and/or negative influences on the environment around them just as the moon would; causing <a href="/wiki/Plant_Growth" title="Plant Growth">plants to grow</a>, <a href="/wiki/Light_Generation" title="Light Generation">light</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Freezing" title="Freezing">freezing</a> and even cause waters to <a href="/wiki/Flood_Creation" title="Flood Creation">flood</a> their surroundings areas.
