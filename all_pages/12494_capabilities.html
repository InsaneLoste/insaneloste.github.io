<p>The user can create any creature (be it real or not and more than likely not) out of imagination for a variety of purposes. They can grant these beings varying levels of detail (simple to intricate), independence (controlled, programmed, semi-independent or autonomous) and existence (momentary to permanent) and delete the entities once they are done with them. Stronger users of this power are able to create all sorts of entities with a wide variety of attributes such as abilities, skills, appearances, identities and personalities, as well as potentially granting them equipment and other accessories such as clothing or weapons.
