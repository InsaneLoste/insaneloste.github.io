<p>User can create, shape and manipulateÂ storms of a primeval nature. As opposed to regular Storm Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiments of the storms themselves. As such, they can cause natural storm-related phenomena to manifest, such as disasterous rain, lightining, wind and snow/ice storms. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Storm Manipulation as storms represents the domain of the user.
