<p>The user has at least one supernatural internal organ (brain, <a href="/wiki/Supernatural_Heart" title="Supernatural Heart">heart</a>, lungs, etc.) which naturally imbues them with supernatural advancements (mechanical, magical, etc) that can grant abilities, powers and even protection. Due to the supernatural advancement of the organs all fundamental structures/functions and natural aspects also gain supernatural properties to better develop their organs to enhance the userâ€™s fundamental qualities which they can use for various purposes.
