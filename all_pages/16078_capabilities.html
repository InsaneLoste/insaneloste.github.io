<p>The user can rewrite how motion occurs for anything. This means instead of going in a straight line at a constant speed unless affected by outside forces, the target can do things like speed up after a number of seconds, stop after a long time or change direction multiple times during motion. That is just a few of the possibilities, as the rest of the possibilities are endless. The user also can change how the target reacts to physical forces that are exerted on them.
