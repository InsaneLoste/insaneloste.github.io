<p>The user can move, act and attack using things that are not there as if they are there. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Miming" title="Miming">Miming</a>, this is not limited to actions and events, but also properties of matter and energy, physics as well as space and time themselves, meaning the user can interact with far distances as if they were close distances, lift heavy objects as if they were light objects, etc.
