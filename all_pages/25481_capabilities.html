<p>The user can change the title of a person, changing what they are and what they are supposed to do. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Hierarchy_Manipulation" title="Hierarchy Manipulation">Hierarchy Manipulation</a>, which mostly deals with ranks and who is superior to each other, titles, in this sense, are what describes a person's position or job, such as being a heavyweight champ in boxing or being the fastest person on earth, among others. The user can change what the title is about as well as grant skills and powers to anyone, as well as what the user has to do while bearing the title.
