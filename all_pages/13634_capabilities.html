<p>The user has the ability to weave knots from ordinary materials and bestow them with supernatural properties that can influence the real world. These knots can be either charged with the creator's magical energy so they have a particular magical use (i.e: protection, health, fertility, etc) or can be used as mediums to effect certain actions through them (i.e: physical harm, wind-bending, etc).
