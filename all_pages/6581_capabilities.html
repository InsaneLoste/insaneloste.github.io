<p>The user is able to move freely and easily in any mean of warping through dimensions. This may depend on the universe the user is in, but if there are particles or radiation the user encounters while going through portals, teleportation, etc., they cannot be slowed by them. The user also does not get lost easily, and they cannot get trapped between dimensions. The user can also change paths to change destinations of where they are dimensionally traveling to, no matter where the tunnel or other means of travel is supposed to lead.
