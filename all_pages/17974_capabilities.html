<p>The user either is or can mimic/transform into <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parasitism" title="wikipedia:Parasitism">parasites</a> - while strictly speaking a parasite tries to keep a host alive and indeed depends on them to exist some variants (known as parasitoids) actively kill their host: in fiction there is not often a distinction made between parasite or parasitoid and thus fictional parasites tend towards being more deadly by default.
