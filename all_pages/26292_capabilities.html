<p>The user has absolute power in the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Underworld" title="wikipedia:Underworld">underworld</a>, a place where the souls of the all recently departed go, an afterlife or realm of the dead located below the realm of the living. Exact conditions of the dead vary depending of the pantheon, but <i>every</i> soul comes there and while some may be punished and others rewarded, for the most the underworld is a place of waiting and either rest or boredom. Users can command the dead, and have powers related to life, and death, souls in general as well as power to bind and restrict (dead are expected to stay there after all). Some may have duties and powers related to death and bringing the souls where they belong. Since the underworld is below earth, many have powers related to earth and minerals, wealth, darkness, and possibly even vegetation (it grows from the earth after all).
