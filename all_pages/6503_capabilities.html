<p>The user can transform into different kinds of digital life forms, whether partially or completely, as well as use the abilities, traits and appearance/physiology of digital life forms. Because digital life forms are made of data and not biological, the user can transform in a digital life form by scanning them like a blueprint or a design. Users may be able to transform into digital life forms they have never encountered. They are able to transform into digital life forms that exist, alien digital life forms and/or digital life forms that are extinct, others may be able to alter their form mentally and change just by seeing and mimicking digital features.
