<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_power" title="wikipedia:Fluid power">fluid power</a>, a scientific system principle that involves pressure applied to fluids (liquids, gases, plasma) to trigger mechanical operations. When fluids are put through required amounts of pressure (such as being forced through tube networks or applied to cylinders), they are can trigger and maintain power for various operations. They can used for mechanical movement, creating kinetic energy or activating engines. Fluid power can exist in nature (like the circulatory and respiratory systems) or through artificial means like engines and tools. Users with this power are capable of controlling applications of fluid pressure or creating constructs that rely on it.
