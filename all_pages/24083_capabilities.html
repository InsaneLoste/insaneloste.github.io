<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sulfur" title="wikipedia:Sulfur">sulfur</a>, a crystalline non-metal which is bright yellow when at room temperature. Chemically, sulfur can react as either an oxidant or a reducing agent. It oxidizes most metals and several nonmetals, including carbon, which leads to its negative charge in most organosulfur compounds, but it reduces several strong oxidants, such as oxygen and fluorine.
