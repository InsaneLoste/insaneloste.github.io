<p>A user with this ability is able to become a werepanther with the ability to transform into a panther or an anthropomorphic hybrid. Unlike werewolves, they aren't particularly connected to the moon or have any weakness for silver or their other traditional weaknesses. The user gains the traits of werepanther, most obvious being ability to change into a panther with the natural characteristics inherent to both panther and humans, including senses, stamina, agility, etc.
