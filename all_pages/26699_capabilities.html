<p>The user has a relationship with a living/semi-living vehicle, granting the user new powers/abilities. The symbiotic relationship may be parasitic, mutually beneficial, or commensalistic, and any powers the vehicle gives is likely to vary depending on what it is. The vehicle can potentially sustain the user when they drive it, so they do not need to eat, drink, sleep, or excrete waste, making the user able to drive for days at a time. If the user is hurt or ill, when they enter the vehicle, they will heal at an unnatural rate, making injuries like a gunshot wound heal overnight.
