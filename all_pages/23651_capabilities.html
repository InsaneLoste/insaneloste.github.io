The splintercat possesses a habit of breaking every tree it comes across with its mighty strong head. It can be concluded that they are not that bright. Their hunting practice includes charging at these trees to determine which tree is hollow or not. This results in them having concussions or sore heads leaving them in a bad mood all the time.
