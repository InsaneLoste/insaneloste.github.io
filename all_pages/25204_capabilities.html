<p>The users can shift the biosphere of any planet, moon, or other celestial bodies into a new environment by terraforming (literally, "Earth-shaping"), ie. deliberately modifying its atmosphere, temperature, surface topography or ecology into a more life-supporting nearly similar to the biosphere of Earth or another world in order to make it habitable to other species.
