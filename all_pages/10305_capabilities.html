<p>The user can "save" a future moment in time and save that moment and skip to it (or go forward to) that point. The user could skip time to that save point whenever they want. This is mostly used when the user or an ally is doing well at something at the current moment, but it can be used when the user is not doing well at the moment, with the risk of skipping time only to be defeated at that time.
