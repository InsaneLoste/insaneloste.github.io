<p>The user has the capabilities to create and assume control of concepts beyond the abstract plane on which most concepts lie. These 'meta-concepts' are of an infinite diversity; those on the lower end of the spectrum, so to speak, operate off of similar fundamentals to normal concepts, and as such can be considered merely to be illogical, insane, contradictory or irrational, whilst those further on are utterly beyond all concepts, logic and illogic alike, being completely transcendent of such things. This means that, though a <a href="/wiki/Logic_Manipulation" title="Logic Manipulation">Logic Manipulator</a> may be capable of wielding the lower end of these meta-concepts, anything greater than that is completely beyond them - any change or defiance of logic means nothing to all but the very lowest of these kind of concepts.
