<p>Technomechanical describes the technological entity taking on the properties and qualities of living beings, being able to bond with or imitate any and all mechanical energy forms right down to the biochemical degree. A technomechanical being is less of a blending of cybernetics and organics yet more of a personification of the ordinarily lifeless, soulless autonomy. Robotics take a semblance of life all their own, learning all new skills and traits which enables them to better grow and evolve more on their own than mere cybernetics will allow. For all intents and purposes, a technomechanical being is a living being in every aspect, possessing systems, sentience, and emotions exactly like an organic creature and functioning as such.
