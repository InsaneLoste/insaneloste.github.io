<p>User can create, shape and manipulate <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Region" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">regions</a>, areas that are broadly divided by physical characteristics (physical geography), human impact characteristics (human geography), and the interaction of humanity and the environment (environmental geography). They can bend/warp regions into unnatural positions and angles, with everything staying in place, in ways that defy logic or physics.
