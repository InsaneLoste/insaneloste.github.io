<p>The user is or can transform their body completely or partially into jawbreakers. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of jawbreakers, in which case it may contain all organs and be somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
