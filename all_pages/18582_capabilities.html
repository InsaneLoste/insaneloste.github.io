<p>The user can manipulate their own personal mathematical aspects. This can entail different effects based on the arithmetical effects they create. One can manipulate their own geometry to alter their overall shape. One could alter physical properties like one’s mass or volume to control features like density. They could even use statistical manipulation to enhance the overall levels of one’s abilities like strength, speed and durability. Since mathematics empirically define the nature of reality, one can potentially control their own existence according to their will.
