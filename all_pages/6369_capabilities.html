<p>The user can gain powers by symbiotically hosting or linking to a destructive/destruction-based being, such as an <a href="/wiki/Destruction_Embodiment" title="Destruction Embodiment">embodiment</a> of annihilation, supernatural beings associated with or in charge of eradication or even entities comprised of destructive energy.
