<p>Users are the authors of their verses, possessing "abilities" that authors would have over their own works, such as being able to <a href="/wiki/Absolute_Change" title="Absolute Change">change</a> and alter any aspect of their work, know everything about it, and <a href="/wiki/Omnilock" title="Omnilock">be completely unreachable</a> to anything in it. They view their verse's characters, powers, and events, as nothing more than words on a page, as they usually are.
