<p>The user either is or can transform into a <a href="/wiki/Android_Physiology" title="Android Physiology">android</a> with near god-like powers. The user has transcended their potential/capabilities beyond their normal limitations, whether physically, mentally, existentially, etc..., while still possessing a synthetic form of organic-like material to resemble it. Due to having evolved themselves beyond their limits in an artificial nature, they gained powers that may be less potent or nigh powerful when compared to regular God-related powers.
