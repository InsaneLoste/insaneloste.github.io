<p>Users possess a supernatural form of freedom and independence that liberates them from laws, rules, fate, predestination, concepts, limits, and other types of cosmic, spiritual, mental, physical and mystical jurisdictions, making the user <a href="/wiki/High_Resistance" title="High Resistance">highly resistant</a> or outright immune to their effects. In theory, the lowest level of freedom amounts to enhanced free will that enables users to act more independently from and/or with an immunity to more 'worldly' limitations such as laws or societal norms. The advanced levels of freedom, however, would liberate users from fundamental aspects of reality and existence, such as <a href="/wiki/Logic_Independence" title="Logic Independence">logic</a>, <a href="/wiki/Causality_Immunity" title="Causality Immunity">causality</a> or even their own <a href="/wiki/Origin_Transcendence" title="Origin Transcendence">origin</a>, with the absolute form of freedom being liberated from absolutely everything and therefore being nothing short of, and solely possessed by, <a href="/wiki/Omnipotence" title="Omnipotence">Omnipotence</a> itself.
