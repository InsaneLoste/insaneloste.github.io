<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fairy" title="wikipedia:Fairy">fairy</a>, a supernatural being that is either a nature spirit, a pagan god, an angel aligned with neither Heaven nor Hell, or something completely else. The way this power manifests varies greatly, but among the possibilities are pointed ears, unusual coloring (hair, skin and/or eyes), and animalistic features (horns, animal ears or eyes, tail, antennae, etc.). Others change their size, manifest sigils over their body, produce an ethereal glow or have no changes at all. Faeries are among the most variable known beings. In terms of morality users can be good or evil but are most commonly neutral.
