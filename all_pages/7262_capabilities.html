<p>Users, in a pair, can combine their strengths to form powerful attacks against common adversaries. For example, if someone with <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Enhanced_Swordsmanship" title="Enhanced Swordsmanship">sword master</a> can watch and cover someone that wields a long-ranged weapon like a <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_Archery" title="Enhanced Archery">bow and arrow</a> or ability. Not only do they do more damage than their combinations alone, but most likely be done at a bigger radius to take out more foes.
