<p>Users possess an impossibly supreme level of beauty/handsomeness so absolute that in any attempts to look up such a magnificent being would drive others to fall for their pure yet incomprehensible beauty or presence for better or worse. Users' beauty proved to be absolutely infinite that even if suppressed to be viewed by others, they will still possess beyond an immense level of mouth-watering form that makes them the most desirable being in existence, even the idea of ever gazing upon their "true" beauty is futile. Even if the user has a scarred face, the users beauty/handsomeness will still transcend the scar.
