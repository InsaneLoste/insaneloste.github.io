<p>User can mimic the motions of other people and objects, whether linear or rotational, without needing any object used for the motion in general. For example, mimic a person swinging on a vine without needing a vine, mimic motions of people turning corners or objects like a yoyo, moving as if they were suspended on a string spinning and doing yoyo tricks. This can be applied to any motion with any possible object being used in the motion, or none at all if there is none.
