<p>The user belongs to a class of wholly or partially non-human beings for whom superhuman capabilities are typical or natural. Almost all Physiologies are non-human, and so the exact capabilities of this power depend greatly on the kind of creature they are. They often have different bodies than humans, requiring more/less/different forms of sustenance, different amounts of sleep (if any), alien body plans, and more. Still, some Non-Human Physiologies can be human-like with differences that are entirely non-physical/metaphysical. Almost any fantastical creature that can be found in fiction can be said to have some variation on this power.
