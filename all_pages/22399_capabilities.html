<p>Users can create, shape, and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shock_wave" title="wikipedia:Shock wave">shockwaves</a>, a powerful compression wave produced by the movement of a body through a medium (liquid, matter, energy, etc.) at a velocity greater than the local speed of sound. Shockwaves typically originate from explosions and sonic booms, resulting in users being able to thrive in situations or locations where those are present. Otherwise, they will be able to generate shockwaves through their power or through other sources (i.e., magical). In terms of offensive capabilities, users would be able to increase a shockwave's power from a miniscule vibration to titanic tremors capable of tearing down buildings to pulverizing continents. Shockwaves can greatly extend the range of melee attacks like punches and kicks. In terms of defensive capabilities, users can use shockwaves to defend from oncoming physical attacks by deflecting or outright destroying them.
