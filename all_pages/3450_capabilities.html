<p>The user is a master of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Street_fighting" title="wikipedia:Street fighting">street fighting</a>, styles of fighting that were literally learned on the streets or on the fly rather than traditional martial arts; effectively, the user is self-taught, their skill being the result of a mass accumulation of experience on the streets and adapting moves from watching and getting into fights. This can throw off others used to more conventional styles.
