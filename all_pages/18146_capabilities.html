<p>Users possess supernatural capabilities, attributes and aspects that are beyond what is naturally possible. With their condition alone, they can dwarf most beings in their respective universe, being virtually supreme in their existential aspects and attributes. With their superhuman physique, they can move buildings, run at the speed of light, survive nuclear explosions unscathed, and remain active for days to weeks untired. With their mind, they can amass knowledge and information about everything, allowing them to invent and create things beyond the grasps of regular humans. They can master languages and subjects in mere days or even hours too.
