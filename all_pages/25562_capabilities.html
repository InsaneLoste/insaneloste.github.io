Totems come in many different forms â€“ animals, plants, metals, gemstones, planets, etc. They share a spiritual, energetic connection with their users in which they serve many roles for them. This includes guardians that protect and watch over them, guides that enter their lives at different points in time to bring them guidance or lessons, allies that assist and support them on their own journey through life, and familiars that carry out tasks for them, to name but a few.
