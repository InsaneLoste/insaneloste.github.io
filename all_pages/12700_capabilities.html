<p>User can increase the thermal energy of objects to cause <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Melting" title="wikipedia:Melting">melting</a>. Viscosity depends on the object being melted, if it has a high-water content then the object could become completely water-like liquid. If the object is rock-like or inorganic, then it may become a thick and mud-like liquid, while metal would become like mercury.
