<p>The user can call forth something from anywhere to help them with a task. The main difference between this and <a href="/wiki/Summoning" title="Summoning">Summoning</a> is that the target being called must come to the caller - it does not just appear in front of the person, and must travel from its current location to the user. Depending on the specifics of the user, the target (the one being called) may be able to resist, and there may be range limitations or limitations on the type of target that can be called. Targets hereditary find themselves supernaturally compelled to go to the user, or they may simply know that the user has called to them. In some cases, often with weapons and other objects, some supernatural quality may aid the target in coming to the user.
