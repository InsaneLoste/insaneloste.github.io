<p>Users with this trait can take on the abilities of an Oboroguruma or are one. A Oboroguruma is a strange spirit from Japanese folklore that takes the form of a large ox-cart with a frightening human face on it - the spirit is not particularly harmful to humans but is anchored to the world between the living and dead due to lingering anger of ancient ox-cart owners who were denied a preferred spot during a period when cart spaces were hotly fought over. As a result, the unhappy spirit of these ox-cart owners become a unique form of tsukumogami in death, forever attached to their prized cart and moving across the world during the hours of night.
