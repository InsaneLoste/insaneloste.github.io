<p>User can create, shape and manipulate <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entropy" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">entropic</a> energy, a measure of the amount of unavailable energy in a system. The amount of this energy varies, as long as the system is not in equilibrium, but it will generally increase until it reaches equilibrium (as stated in the second law of thermodynamics). Entropy is directly related to heat, in that all energy eventually becomes heat. Also, a system is a group of bodies (molecules, atoms, cells) that are related and bound by a common set of characteristics, such as a glass of ice in a warm room. An isolated system is one that is not directly related to any other systems.
