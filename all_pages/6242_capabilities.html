<p>Demonic Resurrection allows an individual to be returned from physical death due to a connection with a demon but in the process gain a wide array of powers beyond those found in life - this is what differs it from other forms of resurrection, due to the evil nature of demons these powers often reflect the user's darkest aspects or greatest desires, twisted to the infernal powers.
