<p>The user can perceive the fourth dimension, which is essentially space-time. Through this ability, the user perceives the world as a sphere around them, enabling them to see all that has transpired, will transpire, could transpire, would transpire, or that might transpire. As like the fourth dimension can be interpreted as the dimension of time flow, it can be applied as a level of higher-dimensional space, impossible to see with our 3D eyes
