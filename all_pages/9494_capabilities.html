<p>The user is a fallen nephilim: nephilim that fell from heaven or was corrupted by malevolence. Having both demonic and angelic abilities of their nature. These types of nephilim were originally the first generation and the source of the concept of "cambion." They were said to possess great strength, giants, and barbarity that caused them to devour any creature they came across, destroy humanity's creations, and fought with their angel parents. They were mistaken for gods, celestial beings, and demigods. The flood soon wiped them out, and angels sent by God executed the surviving. Some texts state they were given a second chance as demons or evil spirits to torment the Earth until the end.
