<p>The user can wear a mecha, either a normal super robot, transforming mecha or humongous mecha, as if it was a suit of armor, but without having to pilot it like a normal mecha. This allows them to make a mecha regardless of its <a href="/wiki/Giant_Robot_Physiology" title="Giant Robot Physiology">size</a> or <a href="/wiki/Amalgam_Machine_Physiology" title="Amalgam Machine Physiology">shape</a> behave like a normal suit of powered armor and can move it as easily as a normal <a href="/wiki/Power_Suit" title="Power Suit">Power Suit</a>.
