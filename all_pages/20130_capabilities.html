<p>User can lock the properties of anything, allowing them to prevent any outside change/force from affecting the object. Any/all of an objects properties can be locked such as size, weight, mass, gravitational pull, shape, etc. This can also cause the object in question from being broken, damaged or destroyed by making it immutable to change, for example using this power on a vase could make it totally unbreakable to any form of harm whether its physical, conceptual or supernatural.
