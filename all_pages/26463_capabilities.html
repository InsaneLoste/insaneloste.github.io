<p>Users can create/use attacks that cannot be perceived or understood by normal senses or in any other way at all. This includes attacks that move too fast to see, attacks that are so radically different that the mind doesn't know what its witnessing and thus can't see it, attacks that seem to be invisible for whatever reason, and much more.
