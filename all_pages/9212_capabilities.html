<p>The user can switch existences with another being, whether it be an item or an object, whether or not they are willing or not. The user remains in the same body and retains most of their mind, but their family line, being, existence, some memories, powers and their life are switched so that they have the life of the other being, effectively granting their wish of being someone else in life, if they wished to in the first place.
