<p>Users can perform a burst of speed that allows the user to move so fast it appears as if they have teleported (in some cases, the user actually <i>does</i> teleport short distances), many users can sustain only short dashes. Logically speaking, a human user of this ability would have to move at subsonic speeds at minimum to be able to evade the perception and senses of someone. In most cases the user is able to maneuver at the high speeds accurately and does not cause any shock or disturbance to the surface they step on. This technique is commonly used to dodge projectiles, move behind enemies, show off speed, get away from a fight, etc.
