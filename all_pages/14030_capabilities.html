<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate creative/life poison, toxins capable of creating/giving/granting life. This allows them to not only create and give life with their poison, but even grant it sapience/sentience and possibly even free will/soul of its own. Some users may even have enough skill to heal/restore others with their poison.
