<p>The user can utilize the Law Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around lawful power. Laws and rules exert a governing power over existential aspects ranging from social structures to facets of reality. At their most basic level, they are constructed and imposed regulations made by civilizations to create order over unstructured and even chaotic circumstances. This involves practices like proper conduct, limits and boundaries, rewards and punishments. At higher levels related to both the natural and supernatural worlds, they are generally understood to be inescapable and unalterable truths related to how reality functions. They offer explanations to phenomena that would be difficult to understand, creating a conceptual sense of control over the vast scope of seen and unseen creation. Normally, these existential aspects are beyond the realm of personal control; however, through unique practices, one can acquire a particularly potent set of skills based on laws.
