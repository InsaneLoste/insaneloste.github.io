<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_reaction" title="wikipedia:Nuclear reaction">nuclear reactions</a>; reactions involving changes in a nucleus, such as fission, fusion, neutron capture, or radioactive decay. The differences between nuclear and chemical reactions are that chemical reactions occur outside the nucleus, affecting the electrons. In contrast, nuclear reactions affect the nucleus, including protons, neutrons, and possibly even elementary particles like quarks, etc. Nuclear reactions generate energy orders of magnitude greater than chemical reactions. This means that the user can control the reactions that affect the nucleus of the atom, including the nuclear fusion, nuclear fission, transmutation, radiation, and radioactive decay.
