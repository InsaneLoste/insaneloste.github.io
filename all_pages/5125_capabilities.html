<p>The user can manipulate any kind of imitations, copies and replications of anything, whether it be worlds, people, objects, or even universes. Imitations replications or counterparts are not the real thing, or are not real, and those who have this power can manipulate those that are not real. The imitation does not have to be completely like the one it resembles; it can be partial as well.
