<p>Users possess the traits, attributes, characteristics and/or abilities of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kitsune" title="wikipedia:Kitsune">kitsune</a> (Japanese: <i>fox</i>), a fox-spirit, who usually gain their powers by living long and keep growing stronger as they age: the more tails a kitsune has (they may have as many as nine), the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. They achieve this either through full or partial transformation into kitsune, choosing to mimic certain aspects of kitsune, or simply already being a kitsune in the first place. They are often <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Trickster" title="Archetype:Trickster">tricksters</a>, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence, but some act as faithful guardians, friends, lovers, and even wives or husbands.
