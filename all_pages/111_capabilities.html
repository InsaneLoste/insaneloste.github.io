<p>The user can dominate virtually anything and everything, regardless of their <a href="/wiki/Control_Immunity" title="Control Immunity">immunities</a>, <a href="/wiki/Control_Opposition" title="Control Opposition">resistances</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Control_Negation" title="Control Negation">negations</a>.
