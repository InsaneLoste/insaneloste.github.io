<p>User can remove the ability to perceive/understand anything/everything, causing the target to be unable to make any sense of what they seeing anymore. This can cause <a href="/wiki/Pain_Inducement" title="Pain Inducement">intense pain</a> or possibly even lead to <a href="/wiki/Insanity_Inducement" title="Insanity Inducement">madness</a> as the target is no longer able to grasp what they are seeing which might make even the simplest of things like common shapes resemble horrific monsters, and/or even look absolutely featureless like a endless void.
