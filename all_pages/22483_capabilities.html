<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Silk" title="wikipedia:Silk">silk</a>, a natural protein fiber, some forms of which can be woven into textiles. The protein fiber of silk is composed mainly of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fibroin" title="wikipedia:Fibroin">fibroin</a> and is produced by certain insect larvae to form cocoons. The best-known silk is obtained from the cocoons of the larvae of the mulberry silkworm Bombyx mori reared in captivity (sericulture). The shimmering appearance of silk is due to the triangular prism-like structure of the silk fibre, which allows silk cloth to refract incoming light at different angles, thus producing different colors.
