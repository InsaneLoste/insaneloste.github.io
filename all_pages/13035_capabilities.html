<p>Users with these abilities usually exist as "manifestations" of a sentient organism's insecurities. Though usually manifested by physical insecurities, these insecurities aren't bound to do so. Majority of these entities have to exist on a mental or psychic plane to work, but some aren't limited to do so. Some depictions of the power have the entities a living, walking manifestation of insecurities around the world, usually as a manifestation or metaphor for beauty standards. Users are intangible, and can induce insecurity in their victims, or anyone who sees them. There is no limit on if the embodiment must be of a singular character or of every living being. Other times, these insecurities can be "energies" of evil which induce insecurity.
