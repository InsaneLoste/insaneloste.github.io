<p>The user is able to fully restore themselves, instantly nullifying any kind of damage or condition, reviving from any death or destruction and retaining any and all aspects of themselves. This includes memories, personality, experiences, consciousness, soul, body, and in some cases even clothing and held objects. Some users may even choose the location of their restoration, making them extremely difficult to contain, with others even being capable of altering aspects of themselves during resurrection, allowing them to <a href="/wiki/Adaptive_Resurrection" title="Adaptive Resurrection">adapt to what killed them</a> or even <a href="/wiki/Resurrective_Rebirth" title="Resurrective Rebirth">remake aspects of themselves entirely</a>. Other users may respawn at a specific location, or only ever restore to their prior state. In any case, regardless of the means of complete destruction or erasure, the user will be able to return. Furthermore, this power cannot be removed by any means, essentially rendering the user completely impossible to permanently kill, destroy or erase.
