<p>Users of this power can take on the powers of the Drapet or are one of these mythical creatures.  Native to France, these entities are said to manifest as ghostly horses who would prowl the countryside looking for foolish children to lure onto their back.  Each time the demon did so, the child would become stuck and the creature would lengthen its form in a horrific fashion so as to abduct great number of children (sometimes in the dozen) and spirit them away to unknown but grisly fates.
