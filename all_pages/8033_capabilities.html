<p>Users of this type of magic can create a "light emblem" that works as a platform for mixing energy that the user collects from the environment (generally energy dispersed in the environment) and their own life-force and then using the result for various purposes, like lighting a dark room, creating personal/special equipment (like weapons, armor, vehicle, etc.) or various types of attacks (from energy attacks to elemental ones).
