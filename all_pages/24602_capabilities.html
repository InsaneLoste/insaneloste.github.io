<p>The user can manifest a power that is an extension of the user's chi/prana/soul/being which may pertain to, represent, stand for, or suggest an, idea, image, belief, action or entity. The symbols pertain to the manifestation/projection of one's soul or inner self into a physical form. This power/ability may or may not use an object or substance (sometimes of significance) to channel one's soul or psyche. By understanding one's power, concept, and/or self, the user's abilities may evolve. These abilities align with the user's moral compass, or alignment (virtues, values). They may also be similar in form to individual personalities, souls, genetics and innate talents.
