<p>User can replicate/recreate the art, art style, and/or even the approach to art as the original artist/painter/sculptor, regardless of the differences used. Allowing them to not only recreate or replicate any piece of art, illustration, drawing, painting, sculpture, etc. so exactly that it not only looks like it was done by the original artist, but even the details, brushstrokes, flaws, or any other intricate aspects or effects are perfectly reproduced; even if it should be (or is) impossible to reproduce them.
