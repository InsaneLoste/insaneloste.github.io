<p>The user can resurrect someone, bringing them back from the dead and also blessing them or otherwise laying a good effect in the process. Such effects range from altering the targets physical/mental being (making them stronger or more intelligent), altering the future to ensure they live a good life or resurrect someone automatically if the targetÂ doesn't want to truly die.
