<p>The user has knowledge of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opera" title="wikipedia:Opera">opera</a>, a form of theatre in which music has a leading role and the parts are taken by singers but is distinct from musical theatre as opera is typically a collaboration between a composer and a librettist and incorporates a number of the performing arts, such as acting, scenery, costume, and sometimes dance or ballet. The performance is typically given in an opera house, accompanied by an orchestra or smaller musical ensemble. Opera is a key part of the Western classical music tradition. Originally understood as an entirely sung piece, in contrast to a play with songs, opera has come to include numerous genres, including some that include spoken dialogue such as musical theatre, Singspiele and op√©ra comique. In traditional number operas, singers employ two styles of singing: recitative, a speech-inflected style, and self-contained arias.
