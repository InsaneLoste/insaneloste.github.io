<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror_matter" title="wikipedia:Mirror matter">mirror matter</a>, a spatial reflection of normal matter. Matter particles can either left-handed or right-handed, so if a regular matter particle were left-handed, its mirror particle would be right-handed, but identical in other ways.  If one was to burn a regular tree, it would release heat -making the area around the tree hotter. In this case of a Mirror Matter Tree, it would absorb heat -making the area around the tree colder.
