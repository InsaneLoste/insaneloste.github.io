<p>User is a living archive or database of knowledge, this basically makes them knowledge itself given physical form. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Encyclopedic_Knowledge" title="Encyclopedic Knowledge">Encyclopedic Knowledge</a> and <a href="/wiki/Omnilegence" title="Omnilegence">Omnilegence</a> however, the user doesn't just store knowledge in a passive manner but as an active agent of knowledge, allowing them to change/manipulate, add to, erase or anything else they wish to knowledge.
