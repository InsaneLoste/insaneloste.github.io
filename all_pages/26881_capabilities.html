<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Viscosity" title="wikipedia:Viscosity">viscosity</a>: the resistance of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid" title="wikipedia:Fluid">fluids</a> to a change shape, influencing spraying, injection molding, and surface coating. In everyday terms (and for fluids only), viscosity is "thickness" or "internal friction", thus, water is "thin", having a lower viscosity, while honey is "thick", having a higher viscosity. Put simply, the less viscous the fluid is, the greater its ease of movement (fluidity).
