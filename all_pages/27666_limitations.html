<ul><li>Distance, mass, precision, max power, etc. depend upon of the knowledge, skill, and strength of the user.
<ul><li>Looking through more than one wall may be impossible or confusing.
<ul><li>X-Rays can only be stopped at a receiver, otherwise they expand infinitely.</li></ul></li>
<li>The user may not be able to generate X-rays, being limited to already existing sources of X-Rays, which are extremely limited in the wild, which may render this power useless.
<ul><li>May need X-Ray Generation to generate X-rays on his own to compensate for the lack of X-rays where he finds himself.</li></ul></li>
<li>There may be objects/material that cannot be observed by X-Ray Vision.
<ul><li>Light metals such as aluminium. Wood fragments. Fine plastics. Human hair, lead, and all kinds of metals {Iron ― Tungsten ― Steel ― Gold ― Copper, etc.}.</li></ul></li>
<li>May not be able to see through certain substances.
<ul><li>X-Rays can penetrate matter composed of light elements such as flesh {which is composed of oxygen, hydrogen, and carbon}, but cannot penetrate substances composed of heavier elements such as bone {which is composed of phosphorus and calcium}.</li></ul></li>
<li>Use of actual X-Rays may be harmful to living things over time.
<ul><li>Regular users could develop cancer over time if they use them excessively for long periods, as X-rays can damage and/or possibly disease a cell and make it malignant.
<ul><li>As the user is a living, mobile X-Ray generator, he can make anyone around him sick on a permanent basis.</li></ul></li></ul></li></ul></li></ul>
