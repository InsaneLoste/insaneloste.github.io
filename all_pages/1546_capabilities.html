<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antimatter" title="wikipedia:Antimatter">antimatter</a>, a material composed of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle" title="wikipedia:Antiparticle">antiparticles</a>, which have the same mass as particles of ordinary matter but also opposite charges, as well as other particle properties such as lepton and baryon numbers and quantum spin. Collisions between particles and antiparticles lead to the annihilation of both, giving rise to variable proportions of intense photons (gamma rays), neutrinos, and less massive particle-antiparticle pairs. The total consequence of annihilation is a release of energy available for work, proportional to the total matter and antimatter mass.
