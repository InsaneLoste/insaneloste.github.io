<p>User is immune to lava/magma, being completely invulnerable to direct and indirect effects. To the extreme, the user could very literally bathe in lava/magma without succumbing to its fatal temperatures. The user would have the toughest of immunities, since lava/magma is hot enough to burn down civilizations to ash.
