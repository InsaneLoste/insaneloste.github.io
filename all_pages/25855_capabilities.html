<p>User can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport" title="wikipedia:Transport">transport</a>, or how something travels. With this power, one can manipulate how much distance they actually cover, the actual duration that passes, the direction the target goes, where the target starts and where their destination is. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Travel_Manipulation" title="Travel Manipulation">Travel Manipulation</a>, which deals with means of travel, this deals with actual travel and how it works.
