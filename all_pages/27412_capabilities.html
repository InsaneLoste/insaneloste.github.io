<p>Users, either innately or through training, are masters of wielding <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Whip" title="wikipedia:Whip">whips</a>, a tool that was traditionally designed to strike animals or people to aid in guidance or exert control through pain compliance or fear of pain. The user is able to wield a whip with great proficiency in range, accuracy and speed allowing them to perform feats such as wrapping then pulling things or bringing them closer, binding their opponents, scaring/lashing opponents, binding then snatching other's weapons, swinging from high altitudes and slicing the flesh of their enemies when striking at great speed. The crack of a whip is it breaking the sound barrier, not to mention getting whipped in a vulnerable spot like the belly can slice it open.
