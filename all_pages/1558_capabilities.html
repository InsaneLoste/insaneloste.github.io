<p>The user can utilize the Antithetical Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around opposing power(s). Existentially, there are various aspects that can be considered complementary or opposing: creation and destruction, life and death, darkness and light, yin and yang, etc. Each one possesses its own supernatural qualities that can empower those who train to use them. In unique circumstances, one can control opposite powers simultaneously. Practice and self-enhancement with regards to wielding two opposing powers can grant unnatural power that far exceeds what one could gain if wielding only one of them. One can manifest abilities that possess the best qualities of both powers, potentially circumventing their inherent weaknesses. So long as one trains to maintain a proper balance between the forces, one can manifest powers ranging from physical augmentation to reality manipulation.
