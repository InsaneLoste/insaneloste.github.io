<p>User does not affect things with their actions or any other way, whether energy, diseases, etc. Thus, they could do things like be on fire or be made of fire and not spread their flames to other people or objects. If the user is made of water, they do not lose any water and not drip when they move. They also won't electrocute people if they are being electrocuted by or are made of electricity. They also won't trigger chemical reactions. Anything that can interact with other things that the user has or is, they won't transfer, spread or affect those other things with it. With this ability, things like fire on one's body causing oil to ignite, among many other things, will not happen.
