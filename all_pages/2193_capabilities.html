<p>The user can accelerate themselves in any direction without the need of a physical force. They can accelerate as their inertia worked for acceleration instead of inertia (inertia is the tendency to maintain velocity, but with this power it is the tendency to maintain acceleration, whether it is speed or direction, or both). They can keep on accelerating, and applying a force to maintain that acceleration is completely optional.
