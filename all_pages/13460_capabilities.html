"tree demon"), a mythical creature of the Philippines, described as being a tall (7 to 9 ft), brown, hairy male with a beard. Kapres are normally described as smoking a big ganja pipe, whose strong smell would attract human attention and wearing the indigenous Northern Philippine loincloth known as bahag, and possibly a belt which gives them ability to be invisible to humans.
