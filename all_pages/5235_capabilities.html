<p>The character is a cosmic protector, a god like figure in many cases second only to their supreme creator or creator entities or a space fairing figure that travels between the stars to right wrongs, preserve the balance, or simply fight for themselves while being used by an entity. Cosmic guardians are usually in charge of preserving and sustaining a galaxy, universe, and the multiverse from any threat and keep it balanced or preserved. Although possessing virtually omnipotent powers, a cosmic guardian may probably not be responsible for the creation or destruction of the universe as they only act as judge and enforcer of the universal laws. A guardian is not a physiology or trait but a status which one can either be born with or ascend to become.
