<p>The user can utilize the Conditional Arts, a specialized system of techniques based on contingent power. While there are instances of individuals demonstrating supernatural abilities without difficulty or excessive concentration, there are circumstances where users must meet specific prerequisites to perform certain feats. Conditions can come in various forms: proximity to or distance from a specific target, possessing a particular object, performing certain actions, obeying distinct rules, or even creating a contract. Rules like these define the userâ€™s abilities. As long as they are followed, an individual will be able to wield supernatural might and, if allowed, be able to utilize various skills ranging from the personal (physical augmentation) to the environmental (controlling natural forces) to the existential (warping reality).
