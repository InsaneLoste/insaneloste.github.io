<p>The user can kill a deity/deities or any divine embodiment they may choose to get rid of. They are resistant to the effects of a deity and are capable of killing the specified deity. The user may be a deity with vast or corrupting powers or a being higher than a deity. Because deities are powerful andÂ numerous, it may require instigating a war to kill them all at once.
