<p>The user is made of or can transform their body into elements. This typically includes the <a href="/wiki/Classical_Element_Manipulation" title="Classical Element Manipulation">classical elements</a>, but it could also include exotic things like shadow, plant matter, or plastic depending on the setting.  In some cases, transforming users may still retain their original anatomy (e.g., a humanoid shape and possible even internal organs) while changing only the composition of their physical form. Alternately, some users may transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
