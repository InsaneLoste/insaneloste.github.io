<ul><li>Though strong against <a href="/wiki/Instant_Effect" title="Instant Effect">Instant Healing</a>, it may be very weak to a <a href="/wiki/Regenerative_Healing_Factor" title="Regenerative Healing Factor">Regenerative Healing Factor</a> or <a href="/wiki/Regenerative_Durability" title="Regenerative Durability">Regenerative Durability</a>, as it prevents this power from dealing high damage, while also keeping it from keeping the opponent low on health.</li>
<li>This power may never eventually have a fixed damage when a target has a specific amount of health. This would mean that it would never be able to kill a target on it's own.</li>
<li>This type of damage power's functions may mean that it will take the same time it takes to kill an enemy with little health, as a target with a huge amount of health.</li>
<li>The user of this power may need to have a basic understanding of percentage mathematics to use it properly.</li>
<li>May only work on targets that have <a href="/wiki/Health_Point_Meter" title="Health Point Meter">Health Point Meters</a>.</li>
<li>May not work against opponents with abiotic physiology like <a href="/wiki/Robotization" title="Robotization">Robotization</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Doll_Physiology" title="Doll Physiology">Doll Physiology</a>, <a href="/wiki/Plane_Physiology" title="Plane Physiology">Plane Physiology</a>, etc.</li>
<li>May be weak against certain specific types of <a href="/wiki/Force-Field_Generation" title="Force-Field Generation">Force-Field Generation</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Layered_Durability" title="Layered Durability">Layered Durability</a>.</li></ul>
