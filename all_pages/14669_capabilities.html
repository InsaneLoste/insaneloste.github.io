<p>The user gains magical powers from a bracelet and/or a cuff. The bracelet can be endowed with its own magic or the user can use it to tap into their inner magic. If they can access magic without the bracelet/cuff, the object merely offers special assistance, such as augmentation or providing the user magic they cannot access alone. In certain cases, once a magical bracelet is put on a user, it can be incredibly hard to take off without a certain set of circumstances.
