<p>The user's <a href="/wiki/Symbiotic_Costume" title="Symbiotic Costume">symbiotic suit</a> of sentient metal physically, mentally and spiritually fused together. This armor layering acts in an almost <a href="/wiki/Solipsistic_Manipulation" title="Solipsistic Manipulation">solipsist</a> manner, taking anything and everything about its host, I.e., what they aspire to or desire most about themselves, what personal characteristics one takes the most pride in. Then extracting and magnifying those aspects inside them, externalizing it on the outside.
