<p>Users can redirect any misfortune they experience, possibly to other people or objects. This allows them to always be 'lucky' while everyone around them experiences misfortune. At a more advanced level, users can redirect misfortune that has already been done to them, such as wounds or diseases, ridding them of it as if it never happened.
