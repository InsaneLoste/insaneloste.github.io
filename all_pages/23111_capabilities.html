<p>User can partially project/detach their consciousness/soul/spirit/astral form and move it to a different place with their physical body following in almost an instant. This acts to gives them speed in short bursts (or long term use for long distance travel), and allows them to go anywhere their soul can get to, regardless of whether their body (under normal conditions) could or not (e.g., on top a statue to the right of their throne).
