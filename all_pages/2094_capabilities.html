<p>The user(s) of this power can change the shape of an attack, which can include the width, length, and height, and can be their own attack, or others. This can allow the user to make a projectile such as an energy blast be changed to not hurt the user or others by altering its shape so it can't reach them or deals less damage. Affecting the shape of a projectile can affect the trajectory and aerodynamics of the projectile. The user may also be able to affect their own attacks, letting their attacks reach the target, deal more damage, increase the speed, etc., depending on what part of the attacks shape they alter.
