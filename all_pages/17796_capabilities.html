<p>Users can utilize sheer, overwhelming force (and/or impossible skill) to wield objects far beyond the normal limits of their material properties (such as <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strength_of_materials" title="wikipedia:Strength of materials">strength</a> and <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hardness" title="wikipedia:Hardness">hardness</a>), akin to the legend of a hurricane being able to propel straw and paper with enough force to pierce brick walls and trees. A user of this power could cut open a battle tank with a wooden sword, and the sword would remain sharp, straight, undented, and unbroken.
