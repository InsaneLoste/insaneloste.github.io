<p>The user can make the target hear various kinds of sounds, including <a href="/wiki/Voice_Source_Creation" title="Voice Source Creation">voices</a>, that are perceptible only to said target, usually appearing as though the noise is coming from inside their heads. While not inherently harmful, this ability can be used maliciously, such as creating <a href="/wiki/Multiple_Voices" title="Multiple Voices">infinite voices</a> that can possibly drive the target insane or to a nervous breakdown. They might even be tricked into it is their god or a deceased loved one guiding them. They may also think it is someone whom they had harmed in the past, who was coming back to haunt them. This could also make the victim/opponent think theyâ€™re going insane or are mentally ill because of these voices they are hearing.
