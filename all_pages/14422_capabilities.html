<p>The user of this power can embody logic, the concept of reasoning conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity. The user can thus manipulate the principles of logic with no bounds, allowing the user to achieve fundamentally impossible feats on a whim, freely redefine what's possible and impossible, and ignore all rules like they didn't exist at all. The user can understand anything in no matter what situations.
