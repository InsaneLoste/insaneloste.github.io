<p>The user of this power can control theÂ <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Modulation" title="wikipedia:Modulation">modulation</a>, the process of varying one or more properties of a periodic waveform, called the carrier signal, with a modulating signal which typically contains information to be transmitted. These signals are usually electrons attracted to a wave through a magnetic force, allowing for information to be transmitted through these signals by adjusting the amplitude and frequency of the waves. The user can use this to decipher the information stored in the modulation waves, allowing them to <a href="/wiki/Electrical_Telepathy" title="Electrical Telepathy">read and transmit thoughts through electricity</a>. This can be used to read and transmit computer programming, information from energy signatures, electrical stimuli with structures, and even radio frequency signals).
