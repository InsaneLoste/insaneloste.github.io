<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Urban_legends_and_myths" title="wikipedia:Urban legends and myths">urban legends</a>, stories and characters associated with a particular environment that reportedly happened, though they are usually some type of modernized  fiction. They are often described as having occurred to <i>a friend of a friend,</i> lending them a certain sense of authenticity. While they are associated with some contemporary aspect of whatever culture and/or location that spawned them, they often include supernatural aspects, making them larger than life despite supposedly being real events. Urban legends are often sources of entertainment akin to adventure or, more often than not, horror stories; however, they tend to serve as cautionary tales to warn listeners about certain dangers through nuanced presentation.
