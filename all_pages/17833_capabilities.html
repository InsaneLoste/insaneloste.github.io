<p>Users become the physical manifestation or personification of pain. Users gain the ability to feed off the pain of others and their own pain in order to get stronger. The user can also induce large amounts of pain to others whether physical, emotional, mental, or spiritual. The user can even redirect pain inflicted on the user to the attacker.
