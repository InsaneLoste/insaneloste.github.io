<p>The user can, while running on walls, jump and land back onto the wall instead of falling to the ground as if defying gravity. It is as if the wall is pulling the user to them, instead of the ground. The user can also do moves that involve leaving the ground, such as flips and aerial cartwheels, on walls without falling to the ground.
