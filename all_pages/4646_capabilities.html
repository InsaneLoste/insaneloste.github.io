<p>User is made up of or can transform their body completely into any color (including colors that can't be seen by the human eye). Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of color, in which case it, contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
