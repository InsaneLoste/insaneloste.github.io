<p>The user can control <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog" title="wikipedia:Dog">dogs</a> and all the types of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dog_breed" title="wikipedia:Dog breed">breeds</a>, such as Labradors, Golden Retrievers, German Shepherds, etc. They can make dogs help them in battle when in need or help them in any other troubling situations. Along with controlling the dogs, they may have a bond with the user and remain loyal to them, or they can empathize as well as communicate with dogs too.
