<p>The user is or has the ability to take on the form of a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Qilin" title="wikipedia:Qilin">qilin</a>: a mythical hooved Chinese chimerical creature known throughout various East Asian cultures and is said to appear with the imminent arrival or passing of a wise sage or an illustrious ruler. It is a good omen that brings rui; roughly translated as "serenity" or "prosperity" and often depicted with what looks like fire all over its body. It is sometimes misleadingly called the "Chinese unicorn" due to conflation with the unicorn by Westerners.
