Symbols require specific designs and locations to effectively contain whatever they are meant affect. Sealing must be exercised carefully in order to properly isolate a target. By training in these arts, one can take on unique powers. Users can negate opponentsâ€™ abilities by containing them, either inside their bodies or even remotely.

On the opposite end of the spectrum, one can even unseal targets, unlocking their inner potential or releasing some isolated entity or power.
