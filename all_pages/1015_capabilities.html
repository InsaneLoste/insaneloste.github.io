<p>The user is governed by different physical laws than the rest of the universe, meaning the laws of physics apply differently to them. From physical laws such as the law of conversation of energy to the law of inertia to the law of gravity or spacetime, and the mathematics behind them, the user tends to work differently in many ways. For example, in terms of kinetic energy, the real life formula is K.E. = 1/2 mass x velocity squared. The user could be governed different by going by the equation, K.E. = mass squared times velocity to the fourth power, or any arranged equation, really. This allows the user to produce more kinetic energy and thus, more force, to be produced. But this can be the case for any physical law there is, and could grant the user any physical super power there is from firing energy rays to physical invulnerability.
