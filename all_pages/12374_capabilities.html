<p>The user can create <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ice_storm" title="wikipedia:Ice storm">ice storms</a>, which results in the accumulation of at least 0.25-inch (6.4 mm) of ice on exposed surfaces. They are not violent storms, but instead commonly perceived as gentle rains occurring at temperatures just below freezing. The freezing rain from an ice storm covers everything with heavy, smooth glaze ice. In addition to hazardous driving or walking conditions, branches or even whole trees may break from the weight of ice.
