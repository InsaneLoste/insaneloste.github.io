<p>The user can control the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Telomere" title="wikipedia:Telomere">telomeres</a> of oneself and/or others. Telomeres are a region of repetitive nucleotide sequences at each end of a chromatid, protecting the DNA fragments; they grow shorter as cell division occurs, an indication of the person getting older. Thus, by controlling the telomeres, the user can effectively control one's lifespan.
