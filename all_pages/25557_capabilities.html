<p>User is undetached to any reality and can freely travel throughout the entirety of anything. They can enter, escape and re-visit any part of the Totality in any time: nothing can force them to stay or leave certain locations. Ultimately, users are able to appear in different realities, planes of existence, layers of reality, metaphysical locations and the most distant realities. There's nothing that can stop them as all doors are opened to them. On top of that, those who are unbound to the Totality are also free from its restrictions, which is why this power is mainly used by free beings.
