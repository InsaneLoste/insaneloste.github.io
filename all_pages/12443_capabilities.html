<p>The user can utilize the Illusion Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around illusory power. Illusions are unique phenomena that come in a variety of forms. Normally, due to their ephemeral nature, they are considered innocuous and ultimately, meaningless; however, under a skilled practitioner’s hand, they can actually be very powerful. Training in illusions can allow one to cause potent consequences in victims. One’s actions could be controlled by sense manipulation. Memories and thought processes could be altered or overwritten by mental beguilement. On a large enough scale, illusions could even mask the true nature of one’s surroundings. The most potent illusion practices can bring about physical effects ranging from solidifying optical phenomena into materialized entities to causing psychosomatic effects like pain, injury or even death.
