<p>Users possess the traits, attributes, characteristics and/or abilities of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vampire" title="wikipedia:Vampire">vampire</a>, a being who subsists by feeding on the life essence of living creatures (often in the form of blood), regardless of whether the vampire is undead or a living person/being. They achieve this either through full or partial transformation into vampires, choosing to mimic certain aspects of vampiric beings, or simply already being a vampire in the first place. While all vampires need some form of life-essence, the quality and quantity vary greatly: from daily to rarely, from needing lethal amounts to barely notable, from sentient blood freshly drained to rare steak.
