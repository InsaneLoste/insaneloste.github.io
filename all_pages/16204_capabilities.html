<p>The user can <a href="/wiki/Body_Creation" title="Body Creation">create</a> or <a href="/wiki/Possession" title="Possession">possesses</a> alternate bodies that they can inhabit. Some users may have <a href="/wiki/Multipresence" title="Multipresence">Multipresence</a> and be able to control more than one body at a time. Other users may only be able to control a single body at a given time; such single presence users may actively switch between bodies to suit their needs, or they may be constrained to only switch upon death of the inhabited body. This is different from <a href="/wiki/Replication" title="Replication">Replication</a>, as the bodies can take any form (however, they may be clones of the original as well).
