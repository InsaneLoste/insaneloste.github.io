<p>The user can create, shape, and manipulation <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dystopia" title="wikipedia:Dystopia">Dystopias</a>, realities where probabilities constantly adjust for the suffering of all living things, where every life is not cared for and does not have its needs met and is full of suffering, and all work and live together in disharmony.
