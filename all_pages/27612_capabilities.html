<p>Users are capable of generating and directing speculative structures linking disparate areas in spacetime which are based on a special solution of the Einstein field equations. <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole" title="wikipedia:Wormhole">Wormholes</a> can be visualized as tunnels with two ends at separate points in spacetime (i.e., different locations, different points in time, or both). Many scientists postulate that wormholes are merely projections of a fourth spatial dimension, analogous to how a two-dimensional (2D) being could experience only part of a three-dimensional (3D) object. Theoretically, they can connect across extremely long distances such as a billion light years, or short distances such as a few meters and even different points in time, or even different universes.
