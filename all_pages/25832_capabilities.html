<p>The user of this power possesses and is able to control powers of transformational/shapeshifting. Any power or force capable of (or revolving around) morphing people, animals, objects, place etc. into various forms from merely cosmetic to a complete change of physiology/form complete with their own unique appearance, powers and equipment. These powers manifest as creating and giving transformations to one's self and others, negating transformations, or even erasing them outright. This ability not only grants the user great strength, abilities, and control over numerous variations of transformational energies, but also allows them to overwhelm weaker forms as well as rival that of powerful forms as well.
