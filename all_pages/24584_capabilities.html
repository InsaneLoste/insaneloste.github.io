<p>The user can utilize the Symbol Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around emblematic power. Symbols are artistic designs or figures representing ideas, concepts and/or objects. Their shapes and meanings can be as varied as the people who create them. While they act as representations of material and immaterial aspects, they grant a unique form of power. They create an understanding of the world that would normally be difficult to comprehend or completely unavailable. Letters create words, granting communication and education skills to those who learn them. Notes signify actual sonic tones, enabling one to properly manifest music, another form of artistic representation. Emblems and crests can create a sense of authority based on their meaning and the cultures surrounding them. Runes, traditionally, have been associated with practices like divination and magic.
