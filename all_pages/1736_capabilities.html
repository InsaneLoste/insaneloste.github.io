<p>Users of this ability can take on the traits of a Arkan Sonney (or are one), the Arkan Sonney is a benevolent type of fairy from Manx folklore that resembles a humanoid hedgehog or at times simply a brilliant white hedgehog, in either form they are greatly admired and loved due to their ability to bestow good luck to any that they come across, unlike most fairies they seem to be exclusively benevolent in design and the word itself is often used as a nickname for hedgehogs in Manx culture.
