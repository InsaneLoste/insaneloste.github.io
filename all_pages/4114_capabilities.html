Sources of stored chemical energy include batteries, biomass, fuel substances (gasoline, petroleum, coal). When a chemical reaction occurs, the chemical energy releases into the surrounding area, often taking on new forms like heat, light, sound or kinetic energy. As a side effect of the reaction, the original substance source transforms into a new material.
