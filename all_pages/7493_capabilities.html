<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elastic_energy" title="wikipedia:Elastic energy">elastic energy</a>, i.e., the energy stored in elastic materials (like rubber) or bodies (like springs) that undergo deformation, typically in the form of compression or stretching. The deformation causes the energy to be stored within the material. The greater the amount of stretchiness, compressability or plasticity of the material, the greater the amount of stored elastic energy. Once relieved of its deformation, the material returns to its original state of equilibrium.
