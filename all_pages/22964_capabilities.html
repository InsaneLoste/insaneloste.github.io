<p>The user can gain powers through a symbiotic relationship with a solar entity/sun. The host usually absorbs the energy of the sun or <a href="/wiki/Solar_Embodiment" title="Solar Embodiment">solar embodiment</a> and uses it to enhance their abilities and/or wield supernatural powers. While it may be impossible to play vessel to an actual sun, one can house its essence for the user’s benefit, allowing for energy, elemental and force manipulation powers based on the sun’s nature. Because of the symbiotic relationship between host and sun, both can benefit/suffer from each other’s state of being.
