<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_object" title="wikipedia:Mathematical object">mathematical objects</a>, specialized forms and objects that are connected to the study of mathematics. Conceptually, they can be any figure that has to do with mathematics. They can range from relatively simple figures (numbers like 2, 18, Ï€ and operations like +) to geometric designs (lines, polygons and polyhedrons) to complicated forms like topological entities (e.g., manifolds). Manipulating mathematical objects can enable effects such as altering the nature of expressions and formulas, creating unique multidimensional figures or even manipulating the fabric of reality, depending of the objects involved as well as their values.
