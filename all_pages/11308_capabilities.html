<p>User can transform themselves or parts of themselves (arms, legs, shoulders, etc.) into strong gun-like weapons with massive firepower. One can actually <i>control</i> the movements of such gun-like weapons when fired from both hands at high speeds, displaying a huge amount of destructive power. The possessor of this ability can make the projectiles from their (possibly numerous) equipped arsenal change direction, curve, bend, twist, travel and fly longer distances, lock onto targets and automatically follow targets with perfect precision and accuracy.
