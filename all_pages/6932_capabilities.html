<p>The user can create or use preexisting doors, gates, or any other structure used to open and close off an entrance and use it to go anywhere in the world as long there is a door which they can use to exit. The inside of the door may look like a portal or the actual destination (such as the oval office in the user's closet). The user can turn these off and on, though it may be difficult to do at an inexperienced level. Once opened, anyone can enter the portal, not just the user so he does not have control who can enter or not.
