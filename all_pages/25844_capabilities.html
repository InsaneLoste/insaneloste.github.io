<p>User's body, inside and outside, does not transition in any way (no middle transition, just the beginning and end parts), making it appear as if they are teleporting with movements, and having their bodily functions begin and end almost instantly. Basically, this means the user does not make any steps when running, nor do their neural impulses travel after starting. They just begin and end.
