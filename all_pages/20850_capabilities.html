<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Radiochemistry" title="wikipedia:Radiochemistry">radiochemistry</a>, the chemical properties and reactions of radioactive materials. All matter is made of atoms, which themselves are formed by elementary particles: protons, neutrons and electrons. The center of the atom (nucleus) contains positively-charged protons and non-charged neutrons. The nucleus is surrounded by a “cloud” of negatively-charged electrons. The number of protons defines the element; however, there can be a differing number of neutrons. These different forms (isotopes) can be considered radioactive when they have unstable nuclei that give off excess energy (ionizing radiation). This process, radioactive decay, occurs naturally and often, though at different rates depending on the element. Studies in radiochemistry have been used to determine the ages of prehistoric remains and in applying radiation therapy for cancer patients. Users of this power can manipulate the elementary nature of radioactive materials and/or unleash powerful energies.
