<p>User can create, shape and manipulate Nether, the "chthonian element" and the substance that makes up the Underworld, a subterranean dimension where all souls go when they pass on. Nether is very similar to Aether “the celestial element” in that it is from a plane that exists between the planes of both matter, and energy.
