<p>User is able to spawn, summon, create or transform into a creature/entity that is an extension, manifestation, and/or part of their soul. Each entity is likely to have their own abilities and powers they grant to the user, but these depend on which part of the user's soul each creature represents as well as the abilities/power they already have.
