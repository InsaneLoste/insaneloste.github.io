<p>The users of this power are <a href="/wiki/Demon_Physiology" title="Demon Physiology">demons</a>, horrifying and destructive, even by human understanding. The elder demon comes off as infinitely more horrific and Satanic, even by typical demon nature. Such demonic beings are thought to be "abominable," even by their species' outright chaotically evil standard; their maligned physiological semblance are considered so foreign in nature and attitude that none, not even members of the celestial/infernal set can survive, much less withstand prolonged exposure to such monstrosities. Often spiritual in nature, their true forms can range from any manner of anatomic deformities which make no sense to even the omniscient. Features can include thousands of eyes, copious amounts of coils/tentacles, multiple stubby limbs or none at all, faceless features, tails and entrails decorating their viscera. They are completely otherworldly in nature, despite not actually being eldritch in nature. To most extents, many are perceived as cephalopodic or ethereal in nature; said spirits are often wreathed in infernal smoke or other hellish materials.
