<p>The user is or can turn into a dragon with qualities of an inanimate object. The users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their dragon form, aside of being made of inanimate objects, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
