<p>User can link the properties of anything, allowing them to connect the properties of object so that whatever properties one item has so does the other (if one object is made of ceramic then so now is the other one). This also links what happens to the objects, so if one object is cracked or broken the other one will also break or crack as that that crack is considered a property and the reverse works as well so if one object is fixed so will the linked one.
