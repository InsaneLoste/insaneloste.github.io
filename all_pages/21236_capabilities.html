<p>The user can move anything/everything at any distance just by moving their own body parts (arms/hands/fingers/feet/legs/head/eyes/etc.), allowing them to control anything as if their anatomy were physically attached/connected to everything around them. As such they can do far more than just <a href="/wiki/Remote_Attacks" title="Remote Attacks">attacks</a>, instead they can manipulate the motion of anything at any distance.
