<ul><li>Spring requires solid surface to bounce off, making it useless in midair or soften surfaces such as water and mud. Can be countered if the user can use the air as a medium.</li>
<li>Difficult to control.</li>
<li>Springs may get tangled or bent from repeated usage.</li>
<li>Trajectory is limited to straight-line movement, making user easy to predict. Can be countered if the user can use the spring's elasticity for bending.</li></ul>
