<p>Users with this ability either is or can transform into a feather dragon. A feather dragon isn't born naturally but born when a dragon is modified using magic and/or alchemy for various purposes. The main difference between them and normal dragons is that they have a more aerodynamic structure and have feathers over their scale-made skin similar to an avian creature, or a fur-like coat with scales on the legs, akin to that of a bird's legs. Another difference is that this type of dragon "absorbs" the type of magic that was used to modify them, giving them the ability to also use that same type of magic.Â
