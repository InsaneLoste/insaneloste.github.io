<p>This character is a supreme force that should not be underestimated. As with any dhampir a user can not simply achieve this level of power. It all depends on who the dhampir has inherited their vampire side from. Naturally with a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Transcendent_Vampire_Physiology" title="Transcendent Vampire Physiology">transcendent</a> parent, the dhampir will also be transcendent. As with most transcendent beings a transcendent dhampir mage is able to alter reality on a universal scale. Also the normal dhampir abilities are enhanced to <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Absolute_Condition" title="Absolute Condition">absolute</a> levels with them also being a practitioner of magic who has ascended to a godly state. They have nearly limitless magical power and can almost effortlessly gain access to power hardly touched by any other mystic.
