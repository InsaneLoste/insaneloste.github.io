<p>User is made up of or can transform their body completely into DNA. Users' transformed form is either anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of DNA, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogenous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
