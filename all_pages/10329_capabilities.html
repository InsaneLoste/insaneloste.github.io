<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Frankenstein's_monster" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Frankensteinian monster</a>, a being created from (possibly several) corpses of dead people, or sometimes animals. As they are formed from dead beings, they lack most of the weaknesses of living beings, including need for sustenance or rest, pain, etc. Due to the fact that most such monsters are animated by electrical impulses, they are naturally resistant to electrical attacks, and some may possess other electricity related abilities as well.
