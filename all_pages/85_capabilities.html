<p>Users can buy/barter for absolutely anything, for them absolutely everything has value and can be bought, including people, concepts, elements of reality, etc. Buying may require communion with anthropomorphic personifications of certain concepts or bartering with something other than paper money. Users can give things like their souls, their money, or their lives for any amount of services for a different concept.
