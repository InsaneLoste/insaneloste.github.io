<p>The user can utilize the Sensory Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around perceptive power. Perception-based abilities can take different forms. At the most basic level, one can have enhanced sensory capabilities (sight, hearing, smell, taste, touch) that allow an individual to analyze their surroundings. There are even abilities where one can perceive more intangible aspects like body heat, electrical fields or the passage of time. One can also possess specialized awareness abilities (ESP), where one gains information or sensory data through supernatural means, often psychic. On a remote level, one can manipulate said faculties, enhancing, distorting and/or diminishing them, whether they belong to the user or to others.
