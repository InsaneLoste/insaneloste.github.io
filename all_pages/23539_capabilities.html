<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Spirit" title="wikipedia:Spirit">spirit</a>: a supernatural and conscious (although may not be necessarily sentient) being that in its normal state is incorporeal, invisible, and immaterial. Many spirits are able to materialize either by shifting into a more solid form or by taking a vessel to give them physical shape, which can be done either by possessing an already existing form (either a living being or an object) or by animating and wrapping part of the environment "around" them.
