This, in turn, allows one to produce various ideas, actions and physical constructs. Supernaturally speaking, there are instances of those who can wield their imagination to physically control reality or have it be the source of power for a particular set of preternatural capabilities.

By training in certain practices, one can learn to properly wield their imaginary powers to enhance their combat capabilities, heighten their defenses or manipulate the world around them.
