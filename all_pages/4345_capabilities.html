<p>The user exists “outside of time” and or is immune to time, which makes them immune to its effects and all that is caused by it. This can render the user <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Semi-Immortality" title="Semi-Immortality">ageless</a> as a result. Since the their Consciousness and the users body is not affected by time, they do not expend energy, and therefore neither need to eat nor sleep. Because time does not flow for the user, any diseases also do not progress, thus effectively rendering the user immune to disease symptoms and damage. They may also exhibit regenerative capabilities as a result of their temporal lock, as their bodies will always revert to the point in time in which they were not injured.
