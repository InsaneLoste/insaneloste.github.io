<p>The user has incredible maneuverability/do tasks, actions, attacks, etc. at full speed while doing incredible maneuvers as well, even in the toughest of areas/situations, such as fighting while climbing a mountain wall, running at full speed while in a tight indoors area, doing parkour in a cramped cave, etc. Nothing can hinder their maneuverability, they can do maneuvers without touching things, unless they want to touch/use something.
