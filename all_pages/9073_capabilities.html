<p>User can grant a blissful and resting death to anyone or anything that is stuck being alive, such as <a href="/wiki/Reanimation" title="Reanimation">reanimated</a> corpses and users of <a href="/wiki/Cursed_Resurrection" title="Cursed Resurrection">Cursed Resurrection</a>, but without actually having to kill them. This can bypass/ignore powers that force the target to stay alive unnaturally and also ensures the target affected can stay dead by granting them peace of mind in the afterlife.
