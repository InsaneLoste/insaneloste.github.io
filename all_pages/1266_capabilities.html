<p>The user can ignore their <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Angular_momentum" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">angular momentum</a>, the quantity of one's rotation. Angular Momentum is proportional to the rotational mass (or moment of inertia) and angular velocity (or how fast something spins), and if one goes up, the other goes down. So decreasing rotational mass increases angular velocity and vice versa. This can be done by changing the configuration of a body, or how well it is spread out. Since the human body's motion is mainly rotational, this can allow for a variety of feats, including moving and doing things faster (running faster with their legs stretched out completely) than other people can by ignoring the relationship between rotational mass and angular velocity and how it affects them.
