<p>The user has great ability in terms of chasing others fleeing from the user. Not only does this deal with great speed, or at least being able to keep up with the fleeing person, but the user is able to track the target well to keep up with them, and use parkour to stay on their trail. The user can also know which paths to take to not lose the target and even catch them.
