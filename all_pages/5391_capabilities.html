<p>The user can move on surfaces as if they were part of it, or are actually part of it. Whether they are partially or wholly merged with a surface, the user can move through them if they were an actual surface to move on, as in a  full 2D surface. Some users may look like a work of art as in a drawing when merged with these surfaces. Unlike <a href="/wiki/2D_Interaction" title="2D Interaction">2D Interaction</a>, which lets users treat surfaces as if they had depth, this does not do that.
