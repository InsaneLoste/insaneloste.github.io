<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Questing_Beast" title="wikipedia:Questing Beast">Questing Beast</a>. The Questing Beast is a cross-animal monster appearing in many medieval texts of Arthurian legend and modern works inspired by them. In the French prose cycles, and consequently in the quasi-canon of Le Morte d'Arthur, the hunt for the Beast is the subject of quests futilely undertaken by King Pellinore and his family and finally achieved by Sir Palamedes and his companions.
