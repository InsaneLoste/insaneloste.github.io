<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate light of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Light Manipulation, users of this power are often deities, avatars, or living embodiments of light, in many cases able to override other forms of Light Manipulation as light is the domain of the user. Due to its primordial nature, it goes beyond concepts of good, evil or even neutrality. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunities &amp; resistances to light-based abilities.
