<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Torakoishi or are one.  A Torakoishi (lit. little tiger stone) is a strange but harmless yokai that takes the form of a large stone with legs and tail of a tiger.  Even though it is not a dangerous yokai, it takes pleasure in startling unsuspecting people by pretending to be a normal stone and reveal its true form when they are close enough.
