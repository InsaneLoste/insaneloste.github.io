<p>User can create, shape, and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kinetic_energy" title="wikipedia:Kinetic energy">kinetic energy</a>, the energy possessed by any moving object, i.e. the necessary <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Work_(physics)" title="wikipedia:Work (physics)">work</a> for an object with a given mass to move from its resting position. The kinetic energy gained during the acceleration process changes once the speed also changes, and when the object no longer contains the kinetic energy it has possessed as it accelerates it stops from moving. The work needed to make an object stop accelerating is equivalent to the kinetic energy that it possesses during the initial stage.
