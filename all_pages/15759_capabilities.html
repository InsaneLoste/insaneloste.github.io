<p>Users can bring a world or environment from their mind into reality. These worlds can be materialized from a separate reality that already exists within the user themselves and because these worlds are created from within, they may have their own rules that even the creator is unaware of. These worlds can be a representation of the user or a construct of the user's imagination.
