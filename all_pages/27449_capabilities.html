<p>The user either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wight" title="wikipedia:Wight">Wight</a>, a type of undead or living sentient creature characterized by varying interpretations. Ones portray them as wraith-like creatures, shapeshifters of the dark; Others portray them as a zombie-like being capable turning the recently dead into their fold. One common trait the wights has shown is the hatred to all living things, seeking to extinguish it and driven to wage war to accomplish said goal.
