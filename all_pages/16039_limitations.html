<li>People who personally know either the shifter or the person whose form they took may be able to determine identity.</li>
<li>Users may be conditionally limited to serviceable forms due to requirements of tasks and/or locations (impersonation, locomotion, etc.).</li>
<li>Unconsciousness, excessive pain, and/or death may involuntarily revert the user to original form.</li>
<li>Users may require visual or genetic sampling to have access to likenesses.</li>

<li>Users may be unable to transform into complex machinery (vehicles, projectile weapons, etc.), limited to rudimentary shapes.</li>
<li>Users may be unable to transform into distinct chemicals (combustants, conductors, etc.), limited to elements available to their anatomy.</li>
<li>Users may be unable to change genetic makeup (species, sex, blood type, etc.).</li>
<li>Users may be unable to adopt physics/biology defying powers of new forms.</li>
<li>Users may be unable to augment their natural abilities (strength, speed, etc.)</li>
<li>Users may be unable to thoroughly mimic the abilities of magical creatures, objects, materials, etc.</li>
<li>Users may retain characteristics of original form in a new shape (i.e., color scheme, markings, voice, smell, etc.).</li>
<li>Staying in a single form for extended periods may start affecting user behavior.</li>
<li>Staying in a multitude of forms for extended periods may start affecting the user's access to original form.</li>
<li>Users may be able to change into predesignated forms, but unable to <i>reshape</i> said form for undesignated purposes.</li>
<li>The process of changing shape may be painful.</li>
<li>The process of returning to original form may be difficult.</li>
<li>Users may involuntarily transform in response to physical and/or mental stimuli.</li>
<li>Users might not be able to alter the current structure to their body, as in any changes or injuries they received will remain after transforming to their original form.</li>
<li>Assuming different forms of other people might lead the user to develop <a href="/wiki/Divided_Mind" title="Divided Mind">different personalities</a>.</li>
<li>Too much usage of this power may cause constant glitching/malfunction, or unaware shifting/activation.</li>
<li>The user's clothing may be damaged when changing shape, unless it is part of the user's body or made of a durable material.</li>
<li>Signs of hunger can make it difficult to stay fit.</li></ul>
