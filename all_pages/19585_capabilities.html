<p>The user can sense those who have powers but haven't manifested them yet or cannot access them and can activate them, allowing the target to access their latent powers.  One with this ability simply opens the part of the mind or accesses the DNA that allows the activation of superhuman abilities and faculties within that subject. They cannot bestow abilities; they only release or activate those which are inherently present in the subject's DNA. Used offensively, they can cause abilities to act on their own, or can cause a subject to use their powers when they don't want to (this is called <i>Power Liberation</i>).
