They can construct another's sense of self with nothing but their own <a href="/wiki/Imagination_Manifestation" title="Imagination Manifestation">imagination</a> or inevitably allow their <a href="/wiki/Creation_Manipulation" title="Creation Manipulation">creation</a> to <a href="/wiki/Accelerated_Development" title="Accelerated Development">develop</a> to their own sense of self.
