<p>Users can emit/produce/generate an extremely powerful scream/shriek of high amplitude for a variety of purposes from their vocal cord and mouth, typically for offensive purposes, like causing destruction. The attack usually manifests as a destructive stream or a destructive wave of sonic energy and can only destroy anything in front of the user unless they turn around, moving the scream in the process. Normally whenever the user screams, it requires them to be extremely loud and have a perfect aim. Once the user starts, they can't stop until all the energy is released. The user can also direct their screams over large distances and even send them at specific targets, only affecting the enemy without affecting their allies.
