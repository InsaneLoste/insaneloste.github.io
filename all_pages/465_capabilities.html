<p>The user has the power to create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adamant" title="wikipedia:Adamant">adamant</a>, a mythical metallic substance said to be the hardest of all materials. The metal is diamond-hard and stronger and more resilient than diamond to boot. Its place in fiction affords it a number of unique properties. It is lightweight, allowing one to wield it easily. Though it is extremely hard, it is also brittle, prone to being shattered if struck by something similarly solid. If put through metallurgical processes, it could be made into a particularly strong alloy (often referred to as adamantine). It becomes heavier in exchange for heightened physical resilience. It is also said to be magnetic, allowing it to manipulate other metallic substances. Thanks to these features, one can use adamant to especially durable weapons and armor.
