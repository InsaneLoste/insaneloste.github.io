<p>The user has access to an object that grants them holiday-based powers. Its nature varies based on the actual characteristics of the object (artifacts, accessories) and the conceptual basis of the holiday to which it is connected. The object may draw power from an entity that represents the festival (whether being created by it or acting as a conduit). It could even be born from the supernatural essence of a particular date of special significance. Regardless of origins, the wielder can use the item to attain potent abilities connected to a holiday and its aspects.
