<p>Users are able to be a step ahead of competition or seem to know where their target is at all times via a psychic mind. An extreme example would be the time when the user murdered enemies or threats in other states or countries. (i.e. if the target was sitting down or against the wall the user seeks out their minds and trusts their offensive attacks to enter any lethal or vital parts of the enemyâ€™s body in the perfect spot).
