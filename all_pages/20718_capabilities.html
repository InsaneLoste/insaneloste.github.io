<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Introduction_to_quantum_mechanics" title="wikipedia:Introduction to quantum mechanics">quantum physics</a>, a branch of physics that explains the behavior of matter and its interactions with energy on a microscopic scale. The interactions in this scale are mostly unpredictable, as particles interact differently in contrast to macroscopic material due to the complexity of quantum mechanics and the universe's fundamental interactions occurring at this level.
