<p>Users are superior in one way or another to the concept of dimensions. They are much different than merely zero-dimensional creatures, as rather than simply lacking dimensions (and thus are geometrically infinitesimal in every possible direction), they are conceptually superior to all forms of dimensional physics. Their existence is fully transcendent of all dimensional levels on a conceptual or existential level, typically being portrayed as entirely external abstractions that lie outside of the applications of spatiotemporal dimensionality as a constant defined by physics on any level, even compared to infinite or uncountably infinite dimensions, usually by perceiving them as akin to fiction or something similarly insignificant.
