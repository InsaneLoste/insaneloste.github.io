<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora" title="wikipedia:Aurora">auroras</a>, a natural light display that can be seen in the sky, usually in Arctic and Antarctic regions of the Earth. Auroras are caused by cosmic rays, solar wind and magnetospheric plasma interacting with the upper atmosphere (thermosphere/exosphere). Their charged particles, mainly electrons and protons, enter the atmosphere from above causing ionization and excitation of atmospheric constituents, and consequent light emissions. Incident protons can also produce emissions as hydrogen atoms after gaining an electron from the atmosphere.
