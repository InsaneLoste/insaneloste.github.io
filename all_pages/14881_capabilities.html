<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magnesium" title="wikipedia:Magnesium">Magnesium</a>, a rather strong, silvery-white, light-weight, highly flammable alkaline earth metal. While it is easy to ignite when powdered or shaved into thin strips, it is difficult to ignite in mass or bulk, but once ignited it is difficult to extinguish. It is the eighth-most-abundant element in the Earth's crust, fourth-most-common element in the Earth as a whole and ninth in the known universe as a whole.
