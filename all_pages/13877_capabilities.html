<p>Users possess the traits, attributes, characteristics and/or abilities of <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Leopard" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">leopards</a>, large spotted cats with fur that is marked with rosettes (while jaguars have larger, more spread-out rosettes that also have spots in the center). They achieve this either through full or partial transformation into leopards, choosing to mimic certain aspects of them, or simply already being a leopard in the first place.
