<p>The user can bring anything from their imagination into reality; from structures, objects, weapons, creatures, elements, or any fictional or non-fictional material that the user can think. The ability can be activated at will but can also be activated through intense concentration, focus, and visualization, to strong emotions that breach the mental plane and the physical plane, constructing "quasi-physical gateways" that bring anything from the other side to the other. Due to its potency, the user can imagine anything that can be real, from changing current events (war, genocides, protests, presidential elections, families, discoveries of riches or artifacts, etc.) into something else, materializing one's imaginative friend into actuality with a composed physical body, or fictional elements that bend the laws of physics.
