<p>The user can call upon or summon a spirit or entity for a specific task, information, or some practical application aimed at manifestation in the physical world. After the operation, the practitioner dismisses or banishes the spirit to leave the room or space of evocation and complete the task. The operant is not offering supplication or service to the entity, and the goal is for the entity to grant the request of the operant. After a successful operation, the magician may choose to supply an offering to the spirit, as this is always good courtesy.
