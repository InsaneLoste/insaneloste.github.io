<p>The user can create and project bolts of light and control the intensity/power of their projectiles, the bolts aren't weak but they aren't as powerful as a <a href="/wiki/Light_Blast" title="Light Blast">full powered</a> attack. These bolts could be used to stun, burn, injure, or even penetrate/stab the enemy.
