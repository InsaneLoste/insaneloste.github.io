<p>User can utilize magnetic, electromagnetic and gravitational forces all in unison for a quantity of effects. Enabling the push, pull, bending, straightening of electromagnetic fields as well as regular attraction/repulsion forces in conjunction with the subtle or intense manipulation of gravity fields for the purpose of changing and altering one's immediate surroundings, be it in a relatively small area of effect or a larger, vaster scale. By creating customized electromagnetic fields, users can create a personalized <a href="/wiki/Effect_Field_Projection" title="Effect Field Projection">Effect Field where</a> the laws of physics have little to no hold upon them. This can also take the form of creating a personalized gravitational field, bending and twisting light around them for invisibility, and spontaneous transport via the creation of <a href="/wiki/Tachyon_Mimicry" title="Tachyon Mimicry">Tachyon fields</a>.
