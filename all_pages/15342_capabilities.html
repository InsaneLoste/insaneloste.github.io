<p>The user can create, shape, and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Meme" title="wikipedia:Meme">memes</a>, ideas, behaviors, or styles that spread by means of imitation from person to person within a culture and often carry symbolic meaning representing a particular phenomenon or theme. A meme acts as a unit for carrying cultural ideas, symbols, or practices, that can be transmitted from one mind to another through writing, speech, gestures, rituals, or other imitable phenomena with a mimicked theme. Supporters of the concept regard memes as cultural analogues to genes in that they self-replicate, mutate, and respond to selective pressures.
