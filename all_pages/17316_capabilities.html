<p>User can do everything at once, all across every moment of their life from birth to death. Every action/every consequence, which are usually merged together, are done in every situation the user is in. This can result in exerting multiple effects onto anything the user interacts with in any situation. Everything every alternate version of the user does will result in happening at the same time in any situation in the user's universe.
