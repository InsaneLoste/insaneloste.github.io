<p>The user can move in any direction other than the forward direction at full speed without changing orientation, no matter what it is. Using any method of locomotion, such as running, flying, jumping, etc., the user can do things like fly backwards, sideways, diagonally, ascend upward and descend downward at full speed, provided they are capable of moving in such directions to begin with using the form of locomotion they use.
