<p>The user is or has the ability to take on the form of a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Griffin</a>, a creature with the body of a lion and the head and wings of an eagle. Most griffins also have bird-like talons, although in some older illustrations, griffins have a lion's forelimbs (and are technically called <i>opinicus</i>), they generally only have a lion's hindquarters. The eagle's head is conventionally given prominent ears; these are sometimes described as the lion's ears but are often elongated (more like a horse's) and sometimes feathered.
