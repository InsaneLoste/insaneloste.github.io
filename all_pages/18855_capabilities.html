<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photochemistry" title="wikipedia:Photochemistry">photochemistry</a>, the scientific field that deals with the relationships between chemical reactions and radiant energy (light). Generally, this deals with what happens when chemical reactions result from photon absorption. This type of science plays a huge role in a number of specialized processes. Photochemistry forms the basis for <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photobiology" title="wikipedia:Photobiology">photobiological</a> phenomena such as <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Photosynthesis" title="wikipedia:Photosynthesis">photosynthesis</a> in plants, where solar energy absorption creates chemical energy, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bioluminescence" title="wikipedia:Bioluminescence">bioluminescence</a>, where organisms use chemical reactions to produce their own light and even <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Visual_perception" title="wikipedia:Visual perception">visual sensation</a>, which comes about by photons interacting with internal chemical activity.
