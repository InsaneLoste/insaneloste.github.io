<p>User can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross" title="wikipedia:Cross">crosses</a> and objects in the shape of a geometrical cross. The cross is one of the most ancient human symbols, and has been used by many religions, most notably Christianity. It may be seen as a division of the world into four elements or cardinal points, or alternately as the union of the concepts of divinity, the vertical line, and the world, the horizontal line.
