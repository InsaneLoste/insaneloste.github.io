<p>While running or walking, users are able to simultaneously teleport themselves short distances along their direction of movement. These teleportations are done in rapid succession, seemingly giving the user superhuman speed. Essentially, not only displacing themselves from their original point of being; but also potentially dislocating themselves from the local timeframe. Enabling oneself to not only shorten distances cutting across or in-between worlds but instances &amp; intervals which they are traversed in as well.
