<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ungulate" title="wikipedia:Ungulate">ungulates</a>, hooved animals that include horses, rhinoceroses, tapirs, cattle, pigs, giraffes, camels, sheep, deer, and hippopotamuses. They can command, speak/understand, evolve/devolve, merge with, possess, etc., with all forms of ungulates. Weaker users can only influence their behavior, commanding them to do their bidding.
