<p>The user is able to move freely and easily in any mean of warping through space. This may depend on the universe the user is in, but if there are any matter or forces the user encounters while going through portals, teleportation, etc., they cannot be slowed by them. The user also does not get lost easily, and they cannot get trapped between spaces or points in space. The user can also change paths to change destinations of where they are time traveling to, no matter where the tunnel or other means of travel is supposed to lead. The user can also move through space unbound regardless of forces existing such as gravity.
