<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatics" title="wikipedia:Pneumatics">pneumatics</a>, the science involving the application of gas pressure to enable mechanical processes. When gas is put through intense pressure, it can generate kinetic energy. The higher the pressure, the greater the amount of energy that is produced. Through specialized processes, one can harness that kind of energy to perform various forms of work. While it can be utilized in sciences like engineering and chemistry, it is often found in different types of technology. <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pneumatic_tool" title="wikipedia:Pneumatic tool">Pneumatic tools</a> can include jackhammers, nail guns and even paint sprayers.
