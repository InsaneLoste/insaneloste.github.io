<p>Users of this power can take on the powers of the Groac'h or are a member of these water-hags, found in the legends of Breton, the name is used for a wide variety of characters but in general a few recurring themes can be found that link them, for example Groac'h are almost always depicted as very old women who live in caves or other isolated areas near the sea (or in some stories may even reside at the bottom of ocean), they can appear quite beautiful or horrifically ugly and while they have a tendency towards malice they can also be depicted as extremely old fairies who spoil anyone they come across with many wondrous gifts.
