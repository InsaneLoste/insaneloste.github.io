There are many instances where individuals learn to demonstrate supernatural abilities channeled from naturally-occurring and/or standardized sources (magical force, primordial force, universal force). There are also cases where some users learn to wield power that is artificial in nature, yet based on the traditional forces that already exist. Although they are synthetic, these forces can still grant users incredible powers. Through training, one can exhibit skills and techniques such as enhanced physical capabilities, mental prowess and supportive practices like healing. Due to its unnatural nature, the force that is the basis for the techniques can run the gamut from being weaker to stronger, stable to unstable, limited to unlimited in availability. Whatever the circumstance, the user can learn specialized skills derived from it.
