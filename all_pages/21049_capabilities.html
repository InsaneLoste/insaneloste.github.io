<p>The user can create a new reality which overlaps reality/space that already exists and become the god of their closed space. Closed spaces take in a number of elements from the real world and may only have a few differences, with such examples being the sky changing into a different color than normal or the presence of unearthly beings seemingly living within the closed space. The user can trap anyone who enters a closed space within their reality or restrict certain people from entering and leaving.
