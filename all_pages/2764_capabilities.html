<p>The user can create, shape, and manipulate bio-generated mechanochemical reaction chemistry, the practice of controlling the relationships between chemical reactions and mechanical operations. It can range from something as simple as rubbing your <a href="/wiki/Igniting_Snap" title="Igniting Snap">middle finger</a> and <a href="/wiki/Shockwave_Snap" title="Shockwave Snap">thumb</a> together in order to create noise to striking a match against a rough surface in order to spark a fire. Both of which are largely applicable through the use of mechanical force to induce chemical reactions, i.e., water (electricity) passing through hydraulic turbines (rotational) using currents to churn out power.
