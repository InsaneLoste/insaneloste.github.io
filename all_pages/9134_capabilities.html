<p>User can ignore and skip events or sequences of events, allowing them to erase entire sections of a plot, narration or timeline, add or remove injuries due to the fact the events that lead to or recovered from those injuries have been ignored/skipped, and even achieve a form of teleportation by simply skipping the events that lead to the destination.
