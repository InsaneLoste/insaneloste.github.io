<p>The user is a frightening anomaly in the field of psychic powers. Unlike other psychics, whose abilities simply strengthen in magnitude as they grow more powerful (greater power, larger scale, keener perception, more precise control), for some reason the userâ€™s own underwent a crucial change of <i>nature</i> at some unknown point, forever turning them into something entirely different. From this moment onward, the user starts to exhibit increasingly disturbing feats that go beyond <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">telepathy</a> and <a href="/wiki/Telekinesis" title="Telekinesis">telekinesis</a> while retaining aspects of both, as if they were fused into something greater, something beyond patterns and understanding.
