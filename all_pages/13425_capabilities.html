<p>Users of this ability are given the supernatural ability to telepathically sense dangers and events connected to the jungle, even events that are happening far outside of said jungle but still have a potential to cause trouble for the jungle - for example one can sense when a new machine is about to be invented that will cause destruction to the jungle or they may sense imminent invasions from poachers or other trespassers, long before they actually arrive within the jungle.
