<p>Users are able to create <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Black_hole" title="wikipedia:Black hole">black holes</a>, a region of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing – no particles or even electromagnetic radiation such as light – can escape from it. With this ability, users can cause indiscriminate and inescapable mass destruction, ripping buildings and people down to sub-atomic particles, consuming entire cities or continents, absorbing anything and everything into it never to be seen again and more. With enough precision, one can generate black holes defensively, sucking in the attacks or weapons of aggressors, completely nullifying any form of offense that may be inflicted. However, users may not be immune to the effects of the black holes they create.
