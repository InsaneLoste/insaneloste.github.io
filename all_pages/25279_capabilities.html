<p>User can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Temperature" title="wikipedia:Temperature">temperature</a>, a form of kinetic energy between particles at the atomic or molecular level: the greater the movement of these particles, the greater the thermal energy and reversed. Heat itself is internal thermal energy that flows from one body of matter to another, it is not the same as the energy contained in a systemâ€”that is, the internal thermal energy of the system. Rather than being "energy-in-residence," heat is "energy-in-transit."
