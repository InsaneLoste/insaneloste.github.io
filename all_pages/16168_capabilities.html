<p>User is able to be reborn/reincarnate into multiple different lives after their death, such as dying and being reborn as two, such as twins, or more completely different people. The multiple reincarnations may have no connection to each other, as they could easily be from different locations, worlds, realities or even times. As such the only connection they would likely share is the same soul is reborn into more then one body.
