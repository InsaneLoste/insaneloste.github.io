<p>Users, either innately or through training, possess superhuman mastery in wielding <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Axe" title="wikipedia:Axe">axes</a>, a bladed implement that has been used for millennia to harvest wood, wielded as a weapon, and even carried as a ceremonial or heraldic symbol. The wielder has reached a level of mastery that allows for relative ease in the dispatching of foes, whether they are of equal, or possibly greater strength. They are able to perform impressive feats such as halting, deflecting, or destroying large projectiles, hacking through incredibly tough objects or barriers, and have the dexterity needed to use wide, sweeping strokes, to attack many enemies at once. They may also be proficient in the wielding of throwing axes, possibly adding ranged attacks to their repertoire.
