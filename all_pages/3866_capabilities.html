<p>Users can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Causality_(physics)" title="wikipedia:Causality (physics)">causality</a>, the relationship between causes and effects, allowing them to decide what happens and what doesn't, when and how. There is no need for a "why" however, as the why of something is determined by causality itself, which is at the users' command, making it one of the few powers that reasonably don't need a reason.
