<p>The user can change direction while jumping between two or more surfaces. This means the user can effectively change the general, overall direction they are going in when jumping on surfaces. For instance, if the user is wall jumping between two walls, but is generally going forward, they can change it so that they are generally going sideways, upwards, downwards, backwards and so on.
