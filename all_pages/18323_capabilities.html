<p>Users have a sense of sight that is glaringly, obviously and super/unnaturally more acute than other beings of their universe because their capabilities are pushed to a super-human level. Allowing them to see kilometers away, see in all directions at once, see in the dark, see the faintest distinctions, and track things too fast for the normal eye.
