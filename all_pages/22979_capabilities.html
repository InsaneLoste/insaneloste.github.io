<p>User can create, shape and manipulate solid fire, flames that look, act and move like a solid object - possibilities ranging from small masses akin to sand to large boulder-like chunks - but have all the properties of fire. Solid fire can fill space like earth but eventually burns and reduces everything to ashes like fire.
