<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Saci_%28Brazilian_folklore%29" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Saci</a>, a famous Brazilian legendary creature, that appears as a one-legged black or mulatto youngster with holes in the palms of his hands, who smokes a pipe and wears a magical red cap that enables him to disappear and reappear wherever he wishes (usually in the middle of a dust devil). Considered an annoying prankster in most parts of Brazil, and a potentially dangerous and malicious creature in others, he will nevertheless grant wishes to anyone who manages to trap him or steal his magic cap. However his cap is often depicted as having a bad smell, most people who claimed to have stolen this cap often say they can never wash the smell away.
