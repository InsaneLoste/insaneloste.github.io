<p>The user can move using appendages to propel themselves and move. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Appendage_Locomotion" title="Appendage Locomotion">Appendage Locomotion</a>, this power uses body parts, even the legs, without those body parts touching the ground to propel oneself. One could even use their legs to do this without touching the ground, or even use their hands and feet as helicopters to lift oneself if they have the ability. This can be done in the air, in the water, along the ground and maybe in space.
