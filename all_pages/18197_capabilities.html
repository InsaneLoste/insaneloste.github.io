<p>The user's jumping ability is at the pinnacle of human potential without being superhuman, allowing them to jump significantly higher and farther than normal humans. Humans at this stage can jump at 10-20 feet tall and leap horizontally 25-50 feet long, examples would be jumping onto a house, small trees, over small sinkholes, etc.
