<p>The user can self-generate vast amounts of dragon force/energy to crush, repel, or destroy objects or entire areas. This power also works well in environments befitting dragon force/energy. This power can cause a target to be paralyzed by the pressure, induce fear, or even kill with only their force/energy. They can cause an attack to be negated or have no effect at all.
