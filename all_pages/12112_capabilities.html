Known as the <i>Gaki</i> in Japan, <i>Egui</i> in China and <i>Preta</i> in India, hungry ghosts are believed to be the souls of the gluttonous, greedy or selfish reincarnated as emaciated, walking revenants with engorged bellies, bony claws, needle-like hair and sometimes pencil-thin throats and/or pinhole-sized mouths, depending on the severity of their sins. Hungry ghosts reside in a ring of Hell that overlaps the plane of the living, meaning that hungry ghosts walk among us at all times but are invisible to the naked eye, watching us eat delicious food and unable to have any unless directly offered some.
