<ul><li><b>All isotopes of californium are radioactive.</b></li>
<li>May be unable to create californium, being limited to manipulating only from already existing sources.</li>
<li>Distance, mass, precision, etc. depend upon of the knowledge, skill, and strength of the user, and their power's natural limits.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Metal_Manipulation" title="Metal Manipulation">Metal Manipulation</a> can over-ride the user's control.</li>
<li>Controlled californium is affected by everything that normal californium would be, although the user is able to use their power to revert the californium into its original shape and/or controlling it even under these forces.</li>
<li>Californium that bioaccumulates in skeletal tissue releases radiation that disrupts the body's ability to form red blood cells.</li></ul>
