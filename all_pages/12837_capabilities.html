<p>Users of this power can <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Injection_(medicine)" title="wikipedia:Injection (medicine)">inject</a> others with some substance to cause an effect. Injected substances could be poisons, medicines, acids, disease-bearing liquids, and more. Injection can happen in a variety of ways - typically in animals it happens through a stinger or through fangs. However, more exotic methods can be found in fiction such as injection via horns, biological blades, or even more exotic means like body parts that change into syringes. The effects of injection depend entirely on the substance injected, though generally these effects are harmful.
