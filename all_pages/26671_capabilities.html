<p>The user can generate and manipulate vector fields that can function either by simply redirecting simple vectors of physics to controlling quantum vectors around the user to provide protection. Applications would include all those of <a href="/wiki/Vector_Manipulation" title="Vector Manipulation">Vector Manipulation</a> but also passively or actively aid in user survivability i.e., increased speed, redirecting attacks, redirecting vectors of light to make the user invisible or distorting an area around the user.
