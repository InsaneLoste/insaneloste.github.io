<p>Users with this ability are at the peak of human conditioning. For this very reason, they <a href="/wiki/Decelerated_Aging" title="Decelerated Aging">age slower</a> than normal members of their species due to having extremely healthy cells, without the superhuman level, extending their lifespan. They could live up to decades with no signs of aging since this ability is at peak human level. Also, this power would activate when the user is in his/her young-adult years, and they'd look twenty-years to even a hundred times younger. For example, the users can be around 70 years old, yet they appear to be in their 30s or they can be 80 years old but appear to be in their 20s or be 120 years old but appear to be in their 40s. The maximum lifespan a human can reach is 140-250 years.
