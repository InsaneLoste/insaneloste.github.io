<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into an embodiment deity, a god/goddess that is the personification of a particular aspect such as an element, force, concept, event or even another type of entity. Gods/Goddesses possess particular dominions, spheres of influence over which they have authority. Throughout mythology, there are instances of deities that, along with their supremacy, actually embody those facets, making them capable of existing everywhere said facet is located. Embodiment deities possess omnipresent power wherever their aspect exists, granting them a unique level of sovereignty.
