<p>The user can utilize telepathic abilities through tactile interactions, allowing them to perceive, manipulate or otherwise interact with other minds through physical contact. Users can also apply this ability to themselves, acting as a personalized version of telepathy. By modifying their cognitive functions as software, users can shift their neural oscillations (brainwaves) to reach a state of relaxation or focus. Allow specific patterns of thought, induce self-subliminal messaging/hypnosis. Users can manipulate their consciousness to gain inner psionic might by unlocking regions of their cerebellum and creating psychic shells.
