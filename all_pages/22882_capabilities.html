<p>User can make small, slow or weak movements, actions and attacks that ignore the forces of gravity and travel farther and do things easier and go on for longer than how they'd do it with gravity and friction affecting them, such as using weak pushes to wall jump instead of the normal required forces or going far with a jump or slide despite friction and gravity being present. The forces the user exerts are lighter and softer, and normally, friction or gravity would make it so that these actions last for a short time. This, however, allow such non-effective actions and movements to be more effective and last longer and thus do things better with them.
