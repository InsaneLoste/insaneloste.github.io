<p>The user can utilize the Miracle Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around miraculous power. Miracles are unique phenomena that often occur in complete opposition to scientific understanding, natural law or general aspects of mathematical likelihood. They are usually associated with supernatural intervention, resulting from prayers to holy (or dark divine) sources. Miracles can take positive forms like healing, restoration, inspiration, protection or negative forms like destruction, degradation, bewilderment or curses. While they are normally brought about through outside influence by higher powers, one can engage in unique practices that allow one to wield miraculous powers themselves. Whether one acts as a vessel for divine/dark divine beings, is imbued with the essence of miracles or learns holy skills, miraculous practices can allow one to manifest thaumaturgy for a variety of feats.
