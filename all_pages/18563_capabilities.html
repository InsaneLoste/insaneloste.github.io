<p>The user is able to manipulate their own personal insulating capabilities and/or possesses their own form of insulation. The user can control their own body's ability to resist (or potentially transfer) matter and/or energy through their body. This resistance capability allows for the immunity, resistance and reflection of unwanted power aimed at the user. In controlling their insulation, they can potentially control conductive abilities to allow for safe internal energy/matter passage.
