<p>User is or can transform their body completely into oil. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of oil, in which case it contains all organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
