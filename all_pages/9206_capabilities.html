<p>User can connect/link their existence to a person, object or place, creating a deep spiritual or metaphysical connection between the two. Allowing them to remain in existence and follow the target they are connected to regardless of what happens to them, so long as they exist in some form. This would also prevent them from ever being truly destroyed so long as the connection remains, even if one of them kills the other their link will remain so long as they exist.
