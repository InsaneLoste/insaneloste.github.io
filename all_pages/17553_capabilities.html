<p>User can mimic/replicate or have skills, powers, attacks, movements, etc. in the opposite way. For example, if the user mimics a person with Time Manipulation powers, they gain space powers. Also, if the opponent can grant good luck, the user, when using this power, grants bad luck, and so on. The user also may innately have powers opposite to those of another person.
