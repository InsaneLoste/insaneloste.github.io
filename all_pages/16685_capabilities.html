<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neanderthal" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Neanderthal</a>, an extinct species or subspecies of the genus Homo which is closely related to modern humans. They weren't anatomically much different from modern humans, aside from the fact that they had a more robust build and distinctive morphological features, especially on the cranium. Evidence suggests they were much stronger than modern humans and they were also not much shorter.
