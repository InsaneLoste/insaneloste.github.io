<p>The user has more than one style of either tasking, moving, acting, fighting, etc. that they can switch into, making it so that the user can change their style or way of doing something. This can be good for tricking opponents into doing something wrong, confusing them, adapting to an opponent's moves, making combinations in one's style or doing something better if one style is not working. Normally, people with a style of doing something find it hard to change their styles in the middle of something because they are so used to doing one style or it is a habit that is hard to overcome. The user does not have those problems.
