<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pulse_(physics)" title="wikipedia:Pulse (physics)">pulse</a>, a disturbance or one of a series of such transient disturbances that moves through a medium (gas, liquid, solid or energy) from one point to the next point. Exact results depend from the medium, strength/frequency of the pulse, whether the medium is fixed in space or free to move at its end and if the pulse moves from one medium to other.
