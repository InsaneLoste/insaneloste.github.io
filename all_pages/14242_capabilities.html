<p>The user can utilize this ability to force a being to face their inner good, either in a mental struggle or bring the victim's light side into the world as a physical being. When a light is faced, they're arguably more powerful than the evil half of the being. They're basically a physical manifestation of the being's past right doing, or current doing. They know the being like they know themselves, and that's a (for evil at least) frightening thought. Victims are either given pause or outright redeemed by the sensation of this ability.
