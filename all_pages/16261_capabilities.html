<p>User can interact with people/objects from other universes/planes of existence without having to leave their own universe. They can effectively fight other people from other universes or talk with them while remaining in their universe, and interact with objects that are otherwise not present in their universe, but in another one like they would normally, like building something with a stack of boxes to climb from another universe.
