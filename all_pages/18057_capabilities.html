<p>User is partially or completely made up of pasta or can transform partially or completely into pasta, including (but not limited to) spaghetti, ravioli, lasagna, ramen, noodle soup, etc. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of pasta and pasta-related ingredients, in which case it may contain all organs. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, with no part of their form being more important than the other.
