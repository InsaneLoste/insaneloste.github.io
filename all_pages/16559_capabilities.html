<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Namekujira or are one. Namekujira are gigantic slug-like yokai found in Japanese folktales and were mostly known for their great size and the fact they would leave behind massive trails of slime wherever they went. Other than this, they acted much like ordinary garden slugs and thus posed no true danger to humans save for their size and the destruction they could cause to crops.
