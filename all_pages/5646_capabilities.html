<p>Users possess unlimited power in <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cyberspace" title="wikipedia:Cyberspace">cyberspace</a> (the global network of computers, information technology infrastructures, telecommunications networks and data storage systems) or virtual reality. This power grants some users vast superhuman abilities that may elevate them to a God-like position in virtual reality or a deity in the real world. The user can manipulate the simulated reality of Cyberspace freely and without limit. The power of a cyberpotent may extend beyond virtual reality and into the real world. The power may even go for a reality warping being from a simulated reality.
