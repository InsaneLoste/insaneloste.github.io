<p>User can move, act and run on all four limbs in a quadrupedal manner, enabling them to move efficiently while on all fours. <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quadrupedalism" title="wikipedia:Quadrupedalism">Quadrupedalism</a> is a form of terrestrial locomotion in animals using four limbs or legs. An animal or machine that usually moves in a quadrupedal manner is known as a quadruped, meaning "four feet" (from the Latin quattuor for "four" and pes for "foot"). The majority of quadrupeds are vertebrate animals, including mammals such as cattle, dogs and cats, and reptiles such as lizards.
