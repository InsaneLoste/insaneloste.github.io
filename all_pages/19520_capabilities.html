<p>The user can manipulate the possibility of things happening, making things possible and/or impossible. For example making it possible for a human to run faster than the speed of light, or make it impossible for machines to work, etc. Unlike Reality Warping, which make things happen, this power doesn't make things happen, for things made possible cannot happen on their own, for something must be tried to do something which would normally be impossible in order for the power to be effective.
