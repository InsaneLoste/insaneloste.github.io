<p>Users, either innately or through training, incredible proficiency and skill in wielding and utilizing two guns at once, most commonly pistols. This gives them an edge in firepower against combatants who utilize only one gun. Users can quickly and effectively subdue huge groups of enemies at once and rain down huge amounts of damage on bigger targets. With the number of bullets/projectiles they can fire, they become extremely deadly in combat.
