<p>The user can exist and not exist simultaneously; they exist physically, and can be remembered in some cases (but gain <a href="/wiki/Unnotability" title="Unnotability">Unnotability</a> if otherwise), but their existence cannot be read or identified and recorded in any way. They do not even appear in videos, art, photographs and books, unless they are intended to be included as a fictional character.
