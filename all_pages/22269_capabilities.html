The Shachihoko is said to control the weather and it’s because of this that the creature has become a reoccurring staple in Japanese architecture during the Sengoku period, using the creature as a symbol to protect shrines and temples from fires by bringing forth rain to douse and put out fires as well as using the creature’s intimidating visage to scare away malevolent spirits in a similar vain to gargoyles.
