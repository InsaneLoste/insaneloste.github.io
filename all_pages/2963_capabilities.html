<p>The user is able to extend the length of bladed weapons (swords, knives, etc.) to varying degrees. In some cases, this creates a sort-of invisible sword, while in other cases, the blade itself stretches. Depending on the blade's construction, it may also be able to stretch and bend at differing angles.
