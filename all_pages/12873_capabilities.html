<p>The user can harness the power of their inner beast; an innate creature that lies within them that grants them great power, strength and ferocity. This allows them to use their unique abilities to vastly increase their own existing ones and/or unlock new ones. The nature of the beast is naturally bound to the user's characteristics, experience and inner nature, which they can ultimately manifest into potentially anything, be they <a href="/wiki/Wild_Inner_Beast" title="Wild Inner Beast">wild</a> or <a href="/wiki/Tame_Inner_Beast" title="Tame Inner Beast">tame</a>, single or <a href="/wiki/Multiple_Inner_Beasts" title="Multiple Inner Beasts">multiple</a>, and so on.
