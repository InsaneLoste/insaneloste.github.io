<p>Users of this ability are given supernatural authority over jungles, often a single jungle but some of them may also hold authority over all jungles in a world, reality, universe or even multiverse. Often, these characters are envisioned as wild but noble, with a deep connection to the animals, plants and magic of the jungle, which is often deeply romanticized due to the fact that, in fiction, jungles and rain forests are often considered the same thing (unlike reality). It may also be the case that jungle lords have influence over rain forests as well, but in general, they tend to exist in fantastical realms that have a host of animals and tribes, some of which would not naturally exist in such conditions (for example many tales have lions living in deep jungle, despite lions living in savannas).
