<p>The user can move freely in any dimension, even if that dimension does not have the space the user needs to perform their movements. For example, they could turn to change directions in the first dimension, sidestep or jump in the second dimension, move around opponents in the zeroth dimension, etc. This can also apply to the third dimension and beyond if the user has access to higher dimensions.
