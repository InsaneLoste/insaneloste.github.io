<p>The user has hair that glows which allows them to generate light, sometimes allowing them to see in the dark clearly. Some users' hair varies in color while glowing. Users may or may not be able to control the color of the glow. In some cases, the hair may glow involuntarily when the user calls on another power. This can cause Glowing Hair to act a sort of limitation, tipping others off that they are or are doing something supernatural.
