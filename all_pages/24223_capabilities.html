<p>The user of this ability is an undead subject of superior power. Much like the rest of the empowered races, meta undead are much stronger than regular undead all thanks to having superpowers, and they tend to be more difficult to dispatch, at least depending on what powers they possess, whether they almost dwarf the power of a <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Undead_Lord_Physiology" title="Undead Lord Physiology">undead lord</a> or not. They can also be much more intelligent than their regular predecessors, at least depending on their power sets.
