<p>User can create, shape or manipulate elements that exist only in dreams/fictions/fantasies/imagination/unrealities. Fantasy elements can come in normal forms like natural elements or forms that are completely outside of logic/sense/understanding allowing them to do things that elements simply shouldn't be able to do or are contradictory to their nature (such as fire that burns before the ignition or restores things instead of burning them, water that makes things dry instead of wet, air that suffocates instead of letting one breathe, etc.).
