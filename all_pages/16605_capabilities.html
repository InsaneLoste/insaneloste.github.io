<p>The user retains the effect of their native forces on other planets. So the viscosity, gravity, air resistance and other forces from the user's home planet are changed, or if they go to another planet or similar sized structure, they retain the effects of such forces with them, making them able to move just as well as they would in their home world. This includes worlds with forces of less or higher intensity.
