<p>The user can control the existence of alternate versions of abstract things such as ideas, feelings, concepts, emotions, states, qualities and events in different, alternate universes as opposed to concrete things. They can change anything that is abstract, making it something new, giving it another definition, making it the same as something else, making it complex or simple, etc. Love can become hate, or an alternate version of the color black, language can mean computer, any emotion can be a state of being, and so forth.
