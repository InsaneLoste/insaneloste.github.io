<ul><li>Can be undone by <a href="/wiki/Space-Time_Restoration" title="Space-Time Restoration">Space-Time Restoration</a>.</li>
<li>All alteration stays. Thus, if the user decided to reverse the stacking, all points that are tampered with that return to their original place in spacetime are changed and this can bring potentially disastrous alterations to the timeline to all events lying to the future of said points</li>
<li>Increases entropy of the multiverse dramatically, due to the massive energy dispersal caused by interacting with multiple events of that location at the same time, or with the heat death</li>
<li>Full power is irreversible without omnipowers due to all possible notions of time is rendered nonexistent</li>
<li>Desired matter and energy may not necessary show up in the location due to their probability fluctuations (otherwise known as wavefunction) cancelling each other out at that point in a manner similar to optical interference (which is how the power get past the problem of "putting an object inside another solid object". The energy contained in the cancellation is not being destroyed, but simply distributed to the nearby probability fluctuations).</li>
<li>Low level uses can only stack events with the same spatial location (or a small region)</li>
<li>For small scale and low-level uses, events will still progress forward in time and interact as a big lump of things, since time is not being stopped.</li>
<li>Become useless when the heat death of the multiverse is reached (where every point in the timeline network has the same maximal amount of entropy, thus no two points are more disordered/energy diluted than another thus the stacking has no net change to the result)</li></ul>
