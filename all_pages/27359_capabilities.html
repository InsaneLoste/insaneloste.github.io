<p>User with this ability is a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Werecat" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">werecat</a> with the ability to transform into a feline such as domestic cat, tiger, lion, leopard, lynx, panther or any other type (even extinct ones). Users donâ€™t have to completely transform into felines, as they can do partial transformations or only use certain traits or characteristics of felines. Unlike werewolves, they aren't particularly connected to moon or have any weaknesses for silver or their other traditional weaknesses.
