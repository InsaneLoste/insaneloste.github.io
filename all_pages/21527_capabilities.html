<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of ropes. They can immediately tell how long a rope is just by looking at (even when it's bundled up). Their vast knowledge of ropes allows them to know how to make ropes and all the knots a rope can make. They also know everything a rope can do, such as hunting, bridge making, boating, netting, swinging, hauling, lassoing, and basket weaving.
