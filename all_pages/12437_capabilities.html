<p>User can create virtually any illogical <a href="/wiki/Weapon_Creation" title="Weapon Creation">weapon</a> from nothing or by shaping existing matter or energy, and how many they wish. Illogical weapons can possess properties/traits that by all rights and logic/reason they shouldn't even be able to possess, such as a normal sword that's able to shoot actual bullets or a cannon that fires things despite not being loaded with any form of ammunition or fires things other than ammunition, and etc.
