<p>The user is made up of or can transform their body completely into clouds: visible collections of particles of water or ice suspended in the air. A user's transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of cloud, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
