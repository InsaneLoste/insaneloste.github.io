<p>The user possesses their own personal vehicle. This inanimate transport is supernaturally linked to the user, allowing them immediate access to transportation, as well as other possible capabilities (built-in weaponry, specialized defenses, sensory equipment). Vehicles can range from the mundane (cars, planes, boats) to the highly advanced (spacecraft, military transport) to the supernatural (flying carpets, mystical chariots, time machines). The inherent connection allows them to wield abilities unavailable to others who may have similar mobile machines. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Vehicular_Symbiosis" title="Vehicular Symbiosis">Vehicular Symbiosis</a>, the vehicle is not necessarily living and/or semi-living, nor does its existence require the wielderâ€™s essence.
