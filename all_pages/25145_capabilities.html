<p>User can "save" the current moment in time and "reload" (or go back to) that point. For everyone else, the time between saving and the moment the user decided to return simply didn't happen, as such only the user would keep the memories of what happened. In practical terms, it could be considered a highly accurate foreknowledge of the future. Just like in a video game, this power gives its user the unique ability to simply "come back and try again" after death; as such, death is a concept that's unimportant to the user. However in online video games, you can respawn but the player doesn't get to load a specific point in time and the power is more the ability to respawn than to save and load.
