<p>The user is made up of or can transform their body completely into ash. A user's transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of ash, in which case it contains all their organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
