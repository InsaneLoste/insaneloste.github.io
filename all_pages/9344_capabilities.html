<p>The user can extend their agility/dexterity capabilities to any object they are holding on/are inside, using the object as their extension without changing their total mass/weight, moving, acting, attacking, doing things, etc. with the object. They can also move objects while they are on them without getting up from them, like sliding them down a path. For example, if the user is inside the box, they can do acrobatics such as rolls, jumps, etc. effectively while inside it.
