<p>The user can create monsters from their id, the part of the mind that contains the instinctual drive and most savage instincts of a human. The beast can take any form depending on the mental state of the user; the more mentally unstable the user is, the more dangerous the monster becomes. Since the monster tends to be a mental image, they typically cannot be seen by regular vision. Additionally, because the monsters are created by the survival instincts, they often cannot be destroyed by anyone or anything other than the user.
