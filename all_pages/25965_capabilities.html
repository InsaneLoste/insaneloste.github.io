<p>The user can see/perceive the <a class="external text" href="https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Higher_self" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">true, inner self of themselves</a> and others, what they truly wish, what they need, without the masks and personas that a recipient wears due to societal pressures. Even knowing things that they themselves do/did not know. Even though this power may seem harmless at first, it must be noted that it gives the user full and unrestricted insight into anyone's greatest fears, dreams, memories and aspirations, etc.
