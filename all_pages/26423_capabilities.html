<p>The user is naturally born with their unnatural aging process; thus, they can’t control it as they live longer or forever. Users are either born with decelerated aging/longevity or eternal youth. It’s common for most users to be born with decelerated aging or longevity, especially as they live longer than humans. It’s also common for other users to be born with accelerated immortality or delayed immortality, especially as they grow rapidly or at normal rate before stopping to age after reaching maturity. Though it’s quite rare for some users to be born with accelerated longevity, especially as they rapidly age and possess a longer lifespan after reaching maturity.
