<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a Basan, fowl-like yokai that breath ghostly, non-burning flames. They’re completely nocturnal, only awaken during the night. The legends say that Basan inhabit remote bamboo groves, far away from human activity. Their diet consists of charred wood and embers, sometimes they would sneak in remote human villages for remains of bonfires or charcoal. If pleased or frightened the basan would beat their wings, creating the distinctive rustling <i>“basabasa”</i> sound which is how they’ve been named. It’s is said that after being seen by humans the basan would completely vanish from thin air.
