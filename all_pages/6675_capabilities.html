<p>The user is a master of <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Disco" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">disco</a>, a genre of dance music and a subculture that emerged in the 1970s from the United States' urban nightlife scene. In the early years, disco dancers danced in a "hang loose" or "freestyle" approach. At first, many dancers improvised their own dance styles and dance steps. Later in the disco era, popular dance styles were developed, including the "Bump", "Penguin", "Boogaloo", "Watergate" and "Robot".
