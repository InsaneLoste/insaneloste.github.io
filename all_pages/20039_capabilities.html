<p>The user can utilize the Probability Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around probabilistic power. Probability, in general, deals with the mathematical likelihood of certain events occurring. Engaging in practices revolving around its control allows one to manifest a variety of potent abilities. One can learn to alter the chances of specific events happening. The complementary manifestations of fortune and misfortune could be directed at specific scenarios or individuals. On a more personal note, learning probability manipulation techniques can enable one to always exhibit beneficial circumstances (wealth, health, power). With sufficient training, an individual could gain the power to impose permanent alterations to a targetâ€™s probabilistic state (whether positive or negative), alter the nature of reality according to mathematical chance or potentially gain a form of nigh-omnipotence based on the odds.
