<p>Users, either innately or through training, have aptitude for the ways of the fighting gauntlet. They are able to wield gauntlets with great proficiency in brutal fist fights and hand-to-hand combat features, allowing them to fight on equal terms with larger and/or stronger opponents, or those holding larger weapons. Some users can savagely beat and pummel their opponent, and even slash them if their gauntlets are bladed. Gauntlets may be empowered by technological and/or supernatural means.
