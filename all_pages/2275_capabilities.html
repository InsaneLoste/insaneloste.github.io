<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of an Azuki Arai or are one, an Azuki Arai is a mysterious yokai that haunts mountainous regions of Japan, living deep in the forests and spending time near streams where humans often encounter them washing beans in a bag, they are often short and squat with large eyes and only three fingers.
They are happy creatures but have a dark sense of humor, enjoying singing morbid tales of how they will catch and eat a human - the spirits have no actual intent to do so and are simply playing pranks (unlike their Azuki Baba cousins).
Often unseen, the appearance of a Azuki Arai is seen as a good omen and the spirit may grant good fortune to those who witness it.
