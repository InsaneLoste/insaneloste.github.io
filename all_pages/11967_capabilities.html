<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/homunculus" title="wikipedia:homunculus">homunculus</a> (plural "homunculi"), a type of artificial human connected to <a href="/wiki/Alchemy" title="Alchemy">Alchemy</a>, from the Latin for "little man". Their traditional depiction is as tiny people grown in jars, but they tend to differ a lot in the presentation. Homunculi generally act as a magician's assistant (a.k.a familiar), spy, messenger, or even assassin. They are capable of speech, though this is not always the case. If created correctly, they are loyal to a fault when it comes to their master.
