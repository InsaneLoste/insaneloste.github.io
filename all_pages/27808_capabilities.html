<p>The user has zero resistance to motion, meaning all external forces and properties are zero and do not resist the user's motion at all. This includes fluid friction, rotational mass, inertia, weight, gravity and friction. They still move and act normally without these forces and properties, even though they are not supposed to act normally by the laws of physics.
