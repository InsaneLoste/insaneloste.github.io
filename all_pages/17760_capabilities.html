<p>The user's soul/spirit isn't similar to their species, resembling some other being's soul, but they themselves are not that being. Their soul can be mixed, bestial, of some other species, supernatural being or something completely else. While this grants them several powers/skills of the being their soul is like, they keep their own species body.
