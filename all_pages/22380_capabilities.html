<p>The user either is or can become a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shikigami" title="wikipedia:Shikigami">Shikigami</a>, a kind of spirit summoned to serve a practitioner of onmyōdō. Some are used as charms for good fortune, some are used as amulets for protection, and some are used as curses. Shikigami usually remain invisible or disguised to human eyes, although those with spiritual powers can normally perceive them. Their power is connected to the spiritual force of their master, and they can take a variety of human or animal forms, possess or bewitch people, and even cause bodily harm or death.
