<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of landing<a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strike_(attack)" title="wikipedia:Strike (attack)"> strikes and physical attacks</a>, able to identify &amp; efficiently strike where their opponents are at their most vulnerable and either inflict maximum damage or disable them non-lethally, either with their limbs or weapons.   This is the ultimate striking mechanism, making the user virtually impossible to block since they will automatically strike with perfect accuracy and precision.
