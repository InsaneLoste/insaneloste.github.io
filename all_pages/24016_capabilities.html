<p>User can combine sublimation/vaporization effects/forces to attacks with bladed weapons, causing direct phase transition of a solid to a gas while bypassing/ignoring the liquid stage. As such a phase transition also absorbs an incredible amount of heat energy in the process, the surrounding area plummets in temperature as a direct result.
