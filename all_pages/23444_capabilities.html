<p>User can extend their speed to other objects and people, meaning they can wield objects faster than normal, push or pull objects or people of any weight faster than they usually can, or make things go faster than they usually can to keep up with the user (like making a computer work faster to keep up with the user's input and typing). They can also make things they are riding on move faster than they normally can. All this can be done whether an object is moving or not.
