<p>User can leave a supernatural imprint/mark that determines which afterlife (if any) the target goes to after they die, allowing them to be judged/sorted easily and send to where a person's soul will go for their final rest. Some targets may have a mark that either prevents them from passing on and/or sends them to nothingness/oblivion when they die.
