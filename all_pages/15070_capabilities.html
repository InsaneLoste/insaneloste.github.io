<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_Corps_Martial_Arts_Program" title="wikipedia:Marine Corps Martial Arts Program">MCMAP</a> (Marine Corps Martial Arts Program), a combat system developed by the United States Marine Corps to combine existing and new hand-to-hand and close quarters combat techniques vary in degrees of lethality, allowing the user to select the most appropriate (usually the least) amount of force. For example, a Marine facing a nonviolent but noncompliant subject can use an unarmed restraint to force compliance with minimal damage and pain. A more aggressive subject could be met with a choke, hold, or a strike. Lethal force can be used on a subject as a last resort. The majority of techniques can be defensive or offensive in use, with or without a weapon, allowing Marines flexibility in combat and operations other than war (such as civil control or humanitarian missions, as well as self-defense). with morale and team-building functions and instruction in the warrior ethos.
