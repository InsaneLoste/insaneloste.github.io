<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sound" title="wikipedia:Sound">sound</a>, a periodic disturbance of a medium (air, ground, water, etc) that radiates outward linearly in the form of a pressure wave. The effect these waves upon the ear is perceived as sound. From the point of view of physics, sound is considered to be the waves of vibratory motion themselves, whether or not they are heard by the human ear.
