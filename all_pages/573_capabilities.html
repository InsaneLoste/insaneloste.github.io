<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of the adze or are one, in the tradition of the Ewe people of West Africa. An adze is an evil spirit that takes the form of a firefly unless it is caught; at which point it turns into a human and when in human form, it has the ability to possess others and cause their negative traits to heighten (for example it would make someone's jealousy intensify or increase bitterness); often those possessed by an adze would become witches or other malicious agents.
