Thermal energy is the energy of substances due to temperature. Within the planet are multiple layers that have been formed by the planet’s tectonic transformation; the planet’s mantle, a layer of molten rock that reaches scorching temperatures, originates from older buried material. The geothermal energy is generated by the radioactive decay of the substances below the planet’s surface giving off thermal energy. Natural formations like hot springs are examples of geothermal activity that can be harnessed for energy usage, like heat and electricity.
