<p>The user can absorb pain/suffering (whether mental and physical) of others, while removing it from the source, into their body and use it in various ways, gaining some form of advantage, either by enhancing themselves, gaining the drained power, using it as power source etc., either temporarily or permanently. This may be like other absorption powers but it can be used as a shield, a cannon, or healing allies.
