<p>The user is a robotic entity which is able to internally perpetuate near limitless quantities of faux life energy. Such entities are often lifeless effigies whom have taken on a near biophysical semblance of their own based upon rather <a href="/wiki/Exotic_Technology" title="Exotic Technology">exotic means</a>. The means are more pseudoscientific than actual hardcore physics that transforms the entire body; from the cellular matrix to the DNA chains, into a perpetuating internal combustion recycler, making the user a focal point for <a href="/wiki/Quintessence_Force" title="Quintessence Force">limitless clean energy</a>. Some users may possess enriched physical and mental efficacy due in part to being a living reactor, being a transmechanical creature. As such they can often wield a simulacrum of incredible life-force or possess what equates a to maximum quintessence force, as a bio-entity.
