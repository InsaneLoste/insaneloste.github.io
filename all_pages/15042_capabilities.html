<p>Users can create and control all forms and species of creatures under the order <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodilia" title="wikipedia:Crocodilia">Crocodilia</a>, such as <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crocodilia" title="wikipedia:Crocodilia">crocodiles</a>, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Alligator" title="wikipedia:Alligator">alligators</a>, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Caiman" title="wikipedia:Caiman">caimans</a> and <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gharial" title="wikipedia:Gharial">gharials/gavials</a>. Holders of this power can order crocodiles to do various things, for example, summon them into battle to fight their enemies, or use them to infiltrate places that would normally be inaccessible to the user. Naturally, they would also be able to communicate with them, read their thoughts and emotions, and form telepathic links with them. More advanced users would be capable of manifesting crocodiles out of thin air, or even manipulating their genetic makeup and DNA to grant them exaggerated predatory features such as sharper claws, tougher scales, large teeth, or making them bigger or more monstrous in general.
