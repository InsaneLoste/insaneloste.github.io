<p>A user can speak in such an obtuse dialog that the very laws of reality tend to bend and distort with each utterance of their unheard-of word. This can cause space-tme disruptions, gravitational modulation, EM/neutrino energy swells, microwave bursts, etc., thanks to deadly wording. Any number of unprecedented effects can occur because of the odd way vocabulary is carried from the vocal cords to the open world.
