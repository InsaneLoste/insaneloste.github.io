<p>The user can create, shape, and manipulate bio-generated nuclear chemistry. This goes beyond just controlling nuclear reactions. With their biofield, they can manipulate the relationship matter has with nuclear energy and forces. This lets them harness safer and more controlled reactions without worrying about regulating energy flow. They can manipulate all nuclear and chemical processes beyond fusion and fission. This makes the user a nuclear-chemical catalyst.
