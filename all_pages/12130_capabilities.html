<p>The user possesses superior powers as a result of being a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Synergy" title="wikipedia:Synergy">synergistic</a> hybrid between two species, making them more powerful than either of their parent races. Hybrid synergy may influence many (up to all) attributes including intellect, strength, speed, vitality, endurance, size, and especially any supernatural powers. Characters with this trait are more likely to inherit any invulnerabilities of either parent or less likely to inherit any vulnerabilities.
