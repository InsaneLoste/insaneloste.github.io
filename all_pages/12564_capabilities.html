the chemical processes of the immune system. The living body is a massive complex made of various systems that operate through chemical processes. The immune system utilizes specific substances and components (immunoglobulins, proteins, leukocytes) to protect the body from various foreign entities, including but not limited to bacteria, viruses, protists, fungi, parasites and outside substances. Upon the the detection of pathogens, the system will use its immunochemicals to mark the offending entities for destruction by the white blood cells.
