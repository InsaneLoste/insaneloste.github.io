<p>The user can compress/force matter into a small/condensed size without damaging the compressed matter, allowing the user to be able to transport fragile objects/beings such as a living person with ease and little to no difficulty. The user is also able to expand the compressed matter back to its original size, allowing the user to transport a large object such as a house by compressing the building and then expanding it back to its original size in a new location.
