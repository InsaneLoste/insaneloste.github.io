<p>The user can gain powers by symbiotically hosting or linking to a summoned being. Normally, a summoner can call forth a contracted being to their aid from another place, often to fight for them in battle. With this power, the user can actually link to their entity, potentially taking on a combined appearance, merging their minds together, gaining access to the contracted creatureâ€™s abilities or even being able to create new powers that the individual parties would not have been able to manifest alone.
