<p>Users can manipulate all kinds of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bivalvia" title="wikipedia:Bivalvia">bivalves</a> including <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clam" title="wikipedia:Clam">clams</a>, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Oyster" title="wikipedia:Oyster">oysters</a>, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mussel" title="wikipedia:Mussel">mussels</a>, <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Scallop" title="wikipedia:Scallop">scallops</a>, etc. Holders of this ability can order bivalves to do various things; for example, they can summon them into battle to fight their enemies or use them to infiltrate places that would normally be inaccessible to the user. Naturally, they could also communicate with them, read their thoughts and emotions and establish telepathic connections with them. More advanced users could create bivalves out of thin air or even manipulate their genetic makeup and DNA to improve their characteristics and qualities.
