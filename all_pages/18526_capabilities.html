<p>The user can manipulate their personal conservation of energy. They can control the laws of how energy is transferred in and out of them and converted to different forms. They are able to draw in energy around them and manipulate it however they like. By extending their own energy outward, they can control preexisting sources around them as well. This is noted to be far different from general energy manipulation of oneself as you are controlling how itâ€™s transferred and converted.
