<p>Users either are or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giant_(mythology)" title="wikipedia:Giant (mythology)">giant</a>, a humanoid being of prodigious size and strength common in the mythology and legends of many different cultures. Most obvious changes are increased size (ranging from relatively normal-sized but big to huge to closer geological scale), strength and endurance. Generally, giants lack any real supernatural abilities, but they can have the same ability to learn as, for example, humans, and some have truly impressive powers.
