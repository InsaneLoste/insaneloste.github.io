<p>User is made up of or can transform their body completely into <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quartz" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">quartz</a>. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of quartz, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
