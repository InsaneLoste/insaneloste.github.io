<p>The user can gain powers through a symbiotic relationship with a star/stellar entity. The host usually absorbs the energy of the star or <a href="/wiki/Stellar_Embodiment" title="Stellar Embodiment">stellar embodiment</a> and uses it to enhance their abilities and/or wield supernatural powers. While it may be impossible to play vessel to an actual star, one can house its essence for the user’s benefit, allowing for energy, elemental and force manipulation powers based on the star’s nature. Because of the symbiotic relationship between host and star, both can benefit/suffer from each other’s state of being.
