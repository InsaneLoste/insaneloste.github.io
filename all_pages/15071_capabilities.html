<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marine_energy" title="wikipedia:Marine energy">marine energy</a>: the energy of oceanic tides, waves, salinity and temperature variances. The moon’s gravitational pull on Earth’s rotating form causes the movement of the ocean’s tides; these moving waters carry with them significant amounts of kinetic energy. The energy can be increased even further when factors like air pressure, wind and formations like inlets and straits are added to the mix.
