<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into an <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Changeling" title="wikipedia:Changeling">changeling</a>, a human-like creature found in folklore throughout Europe. A changeling was believed to be a fairy that had been left in place of a human (typically a child) stolen by other fairies. A changeling is typically identifiable via a number of traits; in Irish legend, a changeling child may appear sickly and will not grow in size like a normal child and may have notable physical characteristics such as a beard or long teeth. They may also display intelligence far beyond their apparent years, as well as possess uncanny insight. A common way that a changeling could identify itself is through displaying unusual behavior when it thinks it is alone, such as jumping about, dancing or playing an instrument â€“ though this last example is found only within Irish and Scottish legends.
