<p>User is made up of or can transform their body completely into weak force. User can be anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of weak force in which case it contains all the organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternatively the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
