<p>The user has a strong connection to an item of personal value which grants them powers and may be able to change its form as needed/to fit users needs. The item's power varies depending on both the user's personality and the object. Some can manifest themselves into living beings or weapons while others don't change form but gain powers related to its natural state e.g a watch that controls time. The object can be used when one has strong emotions.
