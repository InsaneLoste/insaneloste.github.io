<p>Users can acquire information using smell outside the normal range or not connected to their ordinary or physical senses, being extrasensory perception in "smell" form, on distances beyond their normal ranges or being able to sense scents that are beyond their normal olfactory range. They may be able to smell psychic/spiritual levels/beings. In addition, users could psychically perceive smells and nasal sensations from past events, future events or locations currently out of normal human smelling range. Furthermore, they could perceive smells and nasal sensations from other dimensions. They could even psychically receive olfactory and nasal sensations (i.e., itchy nose, stuffy nose, runny nose, anosmia, sneezing, bloody nose), with the presence of psychic energy.
