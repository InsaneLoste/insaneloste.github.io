<p>The user has the ability to move, act and fight even if the user is normally weak or frail, or otherwise unable to do anything, and this is normally done through psionics or magic to make them be able to do things, hence the name. So if the user is physically weak, slow or otherwise physically inept, the user can use psionics, magic or another power to enhance their abilities to the point that they can even do superhuman feats.
