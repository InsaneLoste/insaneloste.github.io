<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a Hell Deity, a god/goddess, or a god-like being who represents or is associated with the afterlife known as Hell. Hell Deities are known to possess powers over death when it comes to those who are going to their realm in Hell, and their powers over evil are not always as great as an Evil Deity's would be. Hell Deities can be found throughout most of recorded history in various forms.
