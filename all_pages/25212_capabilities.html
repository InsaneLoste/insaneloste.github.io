The Terrible Dogfish (In Italian Il Terribile Pescecane) is a dogfish-like sea monster and a fictional character in Carlo Collodi's 1883 book The Adventures of Pinocchio (Le avventure di Pinocchio) as the final antagonist. It is described as being larger than a five-story building, a kilometer long (not including its tail) and sporting three rows of teeth in a mouth that can easily accommodate a train.
