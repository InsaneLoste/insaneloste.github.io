<p>The user can ignore any/all impulses that act on them. Impulse is the rate of change in momentum, or force times time. With that, the user can exert forces for shorter times and still cause great momentum change or treat hard objects as if they were softer and do not harm the user much, if at all. They can also build up force more quickly in shorter amount of times when normally it would take a while to build up force to a certain amount.
