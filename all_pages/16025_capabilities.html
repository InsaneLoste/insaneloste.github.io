<p>The user is or can become a <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moon_rabbit" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">moon rabbit</a>, a mythical figure who lives on the Moon in Far Eastern folklore, based on pareidolia interpretations that identify the dark markings on the near side of the Moon as a rabbit or hare. The folklore originated in China and then spread to other Asian cultures. In East Asian folklore, the rabbit is seen as pounding with a mortar and pestle, but the contents of the mortar differ among Chinese, Japanese and Korean folklore. In Chinese folklore, the rabbit often is portrayed as a companion of the Moon goddess Chang'e, constantly pounding the elixir of life for her and some show the making of cakes or rice cakes; but in Japanese and Korean versions, the rabbit is pounding the ingredients for mochi or some other type of rice cakes. In some Chinese versions, the rabbit pounds medicine for the mortals and some include making of mooncakes. Unrelated moon folklore from certain native cultures of the Americas also has rabbit themes and characters.
