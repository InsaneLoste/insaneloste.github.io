<p>The user can utilize the Exorcism Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around exorcizing power. Exorcism, as a unique aspect of banishment, allows an individual to remove a possessing entity (deity, demon, spirit, etc.) from a host. First, it often involves identifying the nature of the offending being, then acquiring the necessary materials and performing specific acts and speaking special words in order to engage, control and ultimately, remove the being from its victim. While the practice has its own ritualistic aspects, one can acquire unusual abilities through supernatural deliverance training. One can gain enhanced combat ability by combining cleansing powers with martial art skill. The techniques can allow a user to purify/restore the dispossessed host, cleansing them of any negative effects. In some cases, a user could even take control over the invading entity for their own purposes.
