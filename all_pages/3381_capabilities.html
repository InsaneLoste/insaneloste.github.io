<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate boundaries — physical, material, spiritual, existential, pataphysical, logical, conceptual, metaphysical, and so on. Since everything is existentially and conceptually defined by boundaries, the possibilities offered are limitless — for limits themselves are nothing more than the boundary Possible/Impossible, and the user can manipulate even that. Simply put, there is ultimately nothing the user cannot achieve. The user can change their own boundaries to make the impossible possible.
