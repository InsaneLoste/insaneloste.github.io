<p>User can create an uncorrupted/immaculate world, a world, dimension or reality that is completely unspoiled and uncorrupted by anything. Pure worlds are forever free from the trappings of man or any other species greed or corruption. Because of such, they cannot be corrupted by any force and always remain a beautiful, bountiful, and verdant land as they are free from the filth, decay and destruction that would apply to other worlds.
