<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Picotechnology" title="wikipedia:Picotechnology">picomites</a>, machines or robots whose components are at or near the scale of a picoometre. Theoretical devices ranging in size from the scale of trillionths of a meter or picoscale 10^(-12) to 10^(-14). Usually fabricated from nanoscale or molecular level outward. Such an effect allows users to manipulate matter and/or energy states at the atomic, subatomic, and particle levels.
