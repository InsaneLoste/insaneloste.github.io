<p>The user's mere <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Presence" title="Presence">presence</a> in the area or proximity around them is the same as <a href="/wiki/Death_Derivation" title="Death Derivation">death itself</a> by producing <a href="/wiki/Death-Force_Generation" title="Death-Force Generation">death-force energies</a> which effects and changes their surrounding areas through the users own <a href="/wiki/Aura_Generation" title="Aura Generation">aura</a>. The area around user's inexplicable presence can cause negative and deadly influences on the environment around them and everything within that environment; causing plants, animals and other living beings to die, food and wood to rot, and even metal to breakdown and erode. The speed of this process varies on the strength and power of the user with higher entities related to death like <a href="/wiki/Grim_Reaper_Physiology" title="Grim Reaper Physiology">grim reapers</a>, <a href="/wiki/Angel_Physiology" title="Angel Physiology">angels</a> and <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Death_Deity_Physiology" title="Death Deity Physiology">deities of death</a>, or even the entity <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Death" title="Archetype:Death">death</a> itself being the most powerful possessors of this presence who naturally can naturally produce this field within their own divine auras.
