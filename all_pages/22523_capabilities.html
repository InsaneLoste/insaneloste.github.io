<p>User can create <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gravitational_singularity" title="wikipedia:Gravitational singularity">gravitational singularities</a>, where matter is compressed to a point of zero size and space-time curvature is infinite. This usually creates a black hole, where the singularity is "cloaked" by an event horizon (the boundary where the escape velocity equals the speed of light).
