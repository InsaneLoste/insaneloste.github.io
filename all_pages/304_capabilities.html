<p>Users can improve their natural abilities far faster and to a greater extent or beyond the limitations of other members of their species. This applies at a genetic level, allowing the body to keep up with the user's own rapidly developing skills/physical attributes, and at an intellectual level, to which their mind/mental capabilities can develop beyond their normal limits. Users with superpowers benefit the same way, as this power even allows them to awaken any latent abilities within them.
