<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Insulation" title="wikipedia:Insulation">insulation</a>, the ability of a material to impede the flow of energy. Contact between materials enables for the transfer of energy (heat, electricity, sound, etc.). The elemental and/or molecular nature of the material defines how well the energetic transfer occurs, as some materials are more effective than others. <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conductor#Physics" title="wikipedia:Conductor">Conductors</a> are materials capable of easily allowing the flow of energy (electrical power, thermal radiation, sound waves) from a source to a destination. This is often due to a materialâ€™s outermost electrons in its atomic structure having a loose configuration; electron mobility enables conductivity.
