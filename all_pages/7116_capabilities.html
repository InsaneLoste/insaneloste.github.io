<p>The user can materialize the sequences of dreams, nightmares, or visions they or others experienced into reality. The user essentially possesses a potent variant of dream creation; the user doesn't need to be unconscious to dream. They can upload their previous dreams or daydreams while conscious of reality. Another benefit of dream materialization is they can insert their complete dream sequences (from landscapes, environments, materials, objects, organisms, etc.) instead of creating things and beings, carrying out the dream sequence in real time.
