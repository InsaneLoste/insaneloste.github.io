<p>The user can <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Neuroregeneration" title="wikipedia:Neuroregeneration">regenerate their own nerves</a> (which are usually incapable of regeneration) and to return them back to their original state after harm. One with this ability could be stabbed with a knife, and they would only feel it for about a second before the nerves in the wound recovered from the sensation of pain. The user could also use this ability to resist being stunned, going unconscious, going into shock from intense pain or permanently losing sensation in any part of the body.
