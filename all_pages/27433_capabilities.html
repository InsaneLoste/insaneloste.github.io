<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/White_hole" title="wikipedia:White hole">white holes</a>, a hypothetical region of space-time where if you fall inside the white hole you wouldn't reach the singularity (a common misconception is gravity prevents entry, but energy and matter can escape but a white hole is still made up of normal matter so you would be consumed if to close). Considered the antithesis of black holes, general relativity theory says white holes could form from spinning black holes. The singularityâ€™s rotation allows for entry without destruction. Anything entering would pass through a space-time tunnel (<a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole" title="wikipedia:Wormhole">wormhole</a>) and be expelled from a white hole, being set in a different region in space or time period.
