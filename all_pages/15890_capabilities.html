<p><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moksha" title="wikipedia:Moksha">Moksha</a> is the highest state of existence in the Jainism belief system. Beings that inhabit this sector of reality are completely separated from the cycle of reincarnation and exist in a state of perfect omniscience. Only humans are believed to be capable of achieving this state of existence, but any creature can (with time) eventually enter Moksha.
