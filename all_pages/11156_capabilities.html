<p>The user can negate gravity in a certain area whether it be a house, a city or even a planet, causing things to rise from the ground. The user may be able to choose whether or not they are affected by their negation. More advanced users could negate the laws of gravity itself to the point of creating gravitational anomalies (Gravitational singularities, possibly constructs or black holes.)
