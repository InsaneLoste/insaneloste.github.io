<p>User can move and act at a single speed without ever having to change the magnitude of the speed, which is usually quite fast enough to cover a number of distances. This includes whole body and body parts as well as linear and rotational motion. The user constantly defies inertia by changing direction of the body and its parts and using supernatural levels of coordination and control so they don't have to worry about falling or make a mistake.
