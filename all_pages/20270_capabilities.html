<p>Users are pseudo-zombie entities that exhibit part, or all of the usual features associated with actual zombies but lack their magical/supernatural origin. The source of their nature is scientific although some supernatural elements have occasionally been introduced into them. Unlike real monsters, they are not vulnerable to the traditional weaknesses of zombies.
