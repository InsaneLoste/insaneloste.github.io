<p>The user is able to perceive the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrared" title="wikipedia:Infrared">far infrared</a> spectrum (i.e. temperature signatures), allowing them to perceive temperature variations in objects and environment. This ability is incredibly useful for observation purposes, as the user is able to perceive the heat presences of any living targets. This power is capability of seeing biological or artificial systems to detect infrared radiation. The terms thermal vision and thermal imaging, are also commonly used in this context since infrared emissions from a body are directly related to their temperature: hotter objects emit more energy in the infrared spectrum than colder ones.
