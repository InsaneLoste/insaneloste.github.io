Hebrew "wheels", singular ophan) refer to the wheels seen in the Book of Ezekiel and have been associated with Daniel's vision (mentioned as galgal, traditionally "the wheels of galgallin", in "fiery flame" and "burning fire") of the four, eye-covered wheels (each composed of two nested wheels), that move next to the winged Cherubim, beneath the throne of God. These are first construed as angels in one of the Dead Sea scrolls, and as a class of celestial beings in late sections of the Book of Enoch where with the Cherubim and Seraphim they never sleep but guard the throne of God.
