<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Darkness" title="wikipedia:Darkness">darkness</a> and <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shadow" title="wikipedia:Shadow">shadows</a>. Darkness is mostly used to cloud everything into total darkness, but can also be channeled to a variety of effects, both as an absence of light and a solid substance: one can also control and manipulate the beings that exist there, create and dispel shields and areas of total darkness, create constructs and weapons, teleport one's self through massive distances via shadows, etc.
