<p>The user can mimic the mind and DNA of others and use it as their "true-self" without actually changing their outward appearance and personality. This is how it works: The user copies the DNA (including form and powers) and exact mind of another user. They can then activate the copied DNA and mind of the other person at any time. The user still acts, looks, thinks the way they do, as their body and mind are still the same. However, when someone tries to read or duplicate the user, they do not read or duplicate the user, but the person they copied the DNA and mind of earlier. For example, those who read the mind, personality and memories and emotions of the user would find themselves reading the mind of someone else rather than the user.
