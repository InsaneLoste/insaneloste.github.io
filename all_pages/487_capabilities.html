<p>User can increase the difficulty of anything/everything making it adaptive/dynamic, allowing them to make things such as battles, challenges, chores, obstacles, etc. become increasingly even more difficult than it was before. More the opponent/target does them or the better they become at doing them, more the difficulty. The difficulty will increase substantially until they decide to give up and quit.
