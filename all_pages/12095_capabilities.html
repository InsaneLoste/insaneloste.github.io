<p>The users are humanoids; a non-human entity with human-like characteristics as they will have a human-like appearance, usually including binocular vision, long limbs and opposable thumbs, and bipedal locomotion. They can also speak like humans even though they are not humans at all. This trait may be a core aspect of a physiology (such as it is with humans or Dwarfs) or may modify a physiology with which it is not typically associated (such as with modifying <a href="/wiki/Bovine_Physiology" title="Bovine Physiology">Bovine Physiology</a> to create <a href="/wiki/Minotaur_Physiology" title="Minotaur Physiology">Minotaur Physiology</a>).
