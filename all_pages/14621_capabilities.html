<p>The user can transform into different kinds of mechanical life forms, whether partially or completely, as well as use the abilities, traits and appearance/physiology of mechanical life forms. Because mechanical life forms are machine and not biological the user can transform in a mechanical life form by scanning them like a blueprint or a design. Users may be able to transform into mechanical life forms they have never encountered. They are able to transform into mechanical life forms that exist, alien mechanical life forms and/or mechanical life forms that are extinct, others may be able to alter their form mentally and change just by seeing and mimicking mechanical features.
