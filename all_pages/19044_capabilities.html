<p>User is able to survive and adapt to all wide and open plains, ie. flat regions occurring as lowlands and at the bottoms of valleys but also on plateaus or uplands at high elevations, including tundra, prairie, savannah, steppe, veld, etc. As plains offer very little concealment, aside of vegetation (usually grass), plain dwelling animals have sharp senses, usually including exceptional vision, good speed and endurance.
