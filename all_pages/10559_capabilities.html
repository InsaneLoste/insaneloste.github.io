<p>Users possess a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Regeneration_(biology)" title="wikipedia:Regeneration (biology)">regenerative healing factor</a>, meaning that they can rapidly heal and get restored to their optimal and full health/state at an extremely fast rate. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Healing" title="Healing">Healing</a>, regeneration/healing factor is a process that happens unconsciously without the need for activation, resulting in a constant state of optimal health. Regeneration is a process that occurs in all biological entities, but a regenerative healing factor is much more efficient, seamless, and powerful. So much so that users can recreate lost or damaged tissues, organs, and limbs, sometimes slowing, or even stopping aging, something natural regeneration can never accomplish (or does so extremely slowly). The rate and amount of healing vary widely (see <i><a href="#Levels_of_Regeneration">Levels of Regeneration</a></i>); some can <a href="/wiki/Limb_Regrowth" title="Limb Regrowth">regrow missing limbs</a>, others must put the limb back in place for rapid regeneration. The user is generally in very good physical shape, as their bodies are constantly reverting to a healthy state, granting them nigh-inexhaustible stamina and vitality.
