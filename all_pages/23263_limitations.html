<ul><li>May be unable to create sparks, being limited to shaping from already existing sources.</li>
<li>Construct structural strength may be limited by the users will.</li>
<li>In most cases constructs will return back into their original state if the User becomes unconscious, leaves the proximity or otherwise loses contact/control of the item.</li>
<li>May be limited on how complicated constructs they can create (ie. no/limited amount of moving parts).</li>
<li>User's imagination, less creative usually means they can only make simplified constructs, such as geometric shapes and stick figures. Advanced practitioners can make exact replicas of anything they think of.</li>
<li>Can be broken if the amount of force that is applied is greater than the amount the user's imagination can produce.</li>
<li>If the construct takes too much damage it may be difficult to maintain and can break, especially if the user has problems with maintaining focus.</li>
<li>Constructs that are solely used as defensive armor may have their own natural weaknesses.</li></ul>
