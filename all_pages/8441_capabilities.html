<p>The user possesses the highest level of charm they can obtain in existence. Users are able to sway any sentient being they come across to completely agree with them on a biased argument or to join their cause. From groups to races, feeble mortals to the most stagnant divinity of entities, they cannot simply say 'no' to the user. The charisma the user possesses is so high that even beings with immense willpower give in to the user's persuasiveness. Anything about the user in personality, presence, as well as seductiveness is perfect. The user's mere presence is enough to make heads turn in interest. As a treat, users are also able to allure any man or woman they want in a snap, making them think they finally found their "Disney prince" or "princess". Natural or supernatural, conceptual or metaphysical, anything with a sentient mind is vulnerable to the user.
