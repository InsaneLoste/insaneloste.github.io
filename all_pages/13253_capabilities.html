<p>User can create, shape and manipulate <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Ions</a>, atoms in which the total number of electrons is not equal to the total number of protons, giving the atom a net positive or negative electrical charge. Ions can be created by both chemical and physical means. In chemical terms, if a neutral atom loses one or more electrons, it has a net positive charge and is known as a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#Anions_and_cations" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">cation</a>. If an atom gains electrons, it has a net negative charge and is known as an <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ion#Anions_and_cations" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">anion</a>.
