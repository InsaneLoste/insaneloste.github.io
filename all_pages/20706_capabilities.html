<p>User is made up of or can transform their body completely into quantum energy, or constituted by quantum mechanics. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of quantum energy, in which case, it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other. Unlike the usual variations of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Energy_Physiology" title="Energy Physiology">Energy Physiology</a>, the user is subject of the <a href="/wiki/Quantum_Manipulation" title="Quantum Manipulation">quantum physics</a> they're made of, giving them unusual abilities varying the user.
