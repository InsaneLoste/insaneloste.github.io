<p>The user can interact with reflections. This means they can physically touch or play around with their and other's reflections. They might also affect the reflection owner by messing with their reflection. For example, the user might attack an enemy's reflection. The attack will reflect back onto the enemy who cast that reflection. The user might also have the power to make reflections physical and bring them into the physicalÂ world.
