<p>The user can effectively move, act or attack on any surface with less contact time than usual while going at their full action, movement or attack after contact. This is based on the concept of "follow-through", which is related to the concept of impulse in physics which makes it so that the longer a force is applied, the stronger it is than if it were to be if less contact time were applied. Normally, when the force is exerted with less contact time, it isn't effective, but with this power, that is not the case.
