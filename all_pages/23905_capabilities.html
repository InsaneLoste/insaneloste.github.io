<p>The user has the ability to store charge from charged movements and attacks and save it for later. So when they are charging or have fully charged, they do not need to use the move or attack they just charged right away. They could save the action for a later time and release it. Some users can save and use a series of actions instead of one at a later time if they are powerful enough.
