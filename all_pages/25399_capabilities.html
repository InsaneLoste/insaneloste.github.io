<p>User can create and project bolts of temporal energy and control the intensity/power of their projectiles; the bolts aren't weak, but they aren't as powerful as a <a href="/wiki/Energy_Blast" title="Energy Blast">full powered</a> attack. These bolts could be used to stun, burn, injure, or even penetrate/stab the enemy.
