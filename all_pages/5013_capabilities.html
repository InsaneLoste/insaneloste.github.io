<p>The user is in a state of constant death. They are guaranteed to repeatedly die. Some force, whether it is one they supernaturally generate or an external force is creating scenarios for the user to perpetually die. The circumstance heavily differ from users to users. Some users are trapped and have to repeat the same actions and the same death. Other users may be able to go about their day with the caveated that they are attracting things that will kill them. The length of constant death that occurs may be dictated by a set amount of time they must die, a set duration of time such as 80 days, a specific period of time such as once a day, how long to it takes for them to die naturally, until a certain event occurs such as completing a challenge, or it may be infinitely occurring. Unless some other force removes or ends the constant state, the user will die over and over.
