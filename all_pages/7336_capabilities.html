<p>The user is able to emit beams made up of tectonic energy and minerals. The tectonic energy allows for the beams to affect entire areas with accuracy and the tiny minerals allows for damage to remain over time with exposure to the beam. The beam may also be able to hurt or damage an opponent with sheer force much like that of solid rock.
