<p>The user can manipulate esoteric metal with special properties and an esoteric (divine, magic, spiritual, or sentient) nature to it. With mastery, the wielder could use the esoteric element for a variety of supernatural effects. Like other fantastic metals, esoteric metals will posses supernatural material properties, but esoteric metal will have additional esoteric properties such as sentience and/or the ability to emit light or other energies, possibly glowing to warn of an enemy's approach or amplifying the effects of weapon strikes.
