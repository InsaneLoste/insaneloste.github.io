<p>The user can defy any kind of probability. This is not limed to death or danger, but odds in any situation like overcoming a challenge or winning something, especially if the odds are against them. Rather than being just lucky, the user is able to succeed against bad and major, or otherwise unfavorable situations where the odds are against them, all as if they were easy to overcome.
