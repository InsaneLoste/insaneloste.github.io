<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Ninmenju or are one. Ninmenju are strange yokai that manifest as trees that spawn fruit that look like human heads, complete with detailed faces that, while unable to talk, can smile and even laugh. According to legend, making the fruits laugh too hard causes them to wither up and fall.
