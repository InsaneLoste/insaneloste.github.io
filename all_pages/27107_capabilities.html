<p>The user is able to perform a legendary form of magic that allows the user to cast magical spells and feats through water. Water Magic draws on the depths of the oceans and tides, as well as through rivers and lakes that flow back to it. This source is at its strongest during high tide and inside bodies of water, and also strengthens during rainfall. Water Mages are able to command the tides, redirect rivers, or flood a room with water. It also enables a user to communicate with fish and grants the ability to breathe underwater.
