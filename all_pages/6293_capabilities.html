<p>The user has the existence of something, whether another person, physical, spiritual, psychic, conceptual, e.t.c., dependent on their own existence. If the user ceases to be, then so does that very thing. This can occur either locally, within the users own realm/universe, across the multiverse/omni-verse, or across all realms, planes and realities.
