<ul><li>Useless against beings without a <a href="/wiki/Cymatic_Sound_Manipulation" title="Cymatic Sound Manipulation">cymatic sound</a>, such as certain <a href="/wiki/Eldritch_Physiology" title="Eldritch Physiology">Eldritch entities</a> or users of <a href="/wiki/Non-Atomic_Body" title="Non-Atomic Body">Non-Atomic Body</a>.</li>
<li>Cannot be used on beings or objects whose governing universal laws do not include such frequencies.</li>
<li>May not permanently destroy a being who can <a href="/wiki/Reforming" title="Reforming">reform</a> themselves from practically nothing</li>
<li>Each being emits a slightly different frequency and the user must concentrate on creating the correct counter frequency to make their power effective.</li>
<li>All items of interest have their own vibration frequency e.i. skin, rock, atoms, etc; which are all shrouded by one another. focusing on the specific wavelength for a more pinpoint counter becomes all that more difficult.
<ul><li>This extends to the target, with skin, flesh, muscle and bone not only possessing different frequencies but also act to dampen each other, making it far more troublesome to use on beings who aren't entirely composed of a single substance.</li></ul></li>
