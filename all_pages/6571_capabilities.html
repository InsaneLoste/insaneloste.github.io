<p>The user can interact with other dimensions/planes of existence but without having to physically leave the one there currently on, allowing them to use the properties of the other dimensions in the one they normally live in. Such as being able to fly anywhere by interacting with a dimension were gravity doesn't exist or breathe in the vacuum of space by interacting with a dimension of nothing but air, and possibly much more.
