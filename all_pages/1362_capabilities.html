<p>Users with this ability can either mimic the traits of an Aniwye or are one, the Aniwye was a monstrous giant skunk from Native American legend that acted as the legendary primordial ancestor to modern skunks, long ago the Aniwye prowled the lands and had a particular fondness of hunting humans and could emit a stench so foul it would kill a victim instantly, eventually the Aniwye was slain and when it was reincarnated the gods opted to make it far smaller and less deadly, thus the modern skunk was "born".
