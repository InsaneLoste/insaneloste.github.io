<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into the Bisso Galeto. The Bisso Galeto is a legendary creature of the Veronese valleys. It is a monster that has the body and head of a rooster, with a large red crest, wings full of spines and a snake's tail. Its normal size is quite small, making it similar to a small snake, but the Bisso Galeto can increase and decrease its body length at will. It is a very poisonous animal. It would be born from an egg laid by an old rooster and incubated by a snake or a toad for nine years. It also has many recurring characteristics in the basilisk, which is why it is sometimes confused with it.
