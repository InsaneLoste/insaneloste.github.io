<p>Users of Possibility Enforcement are capable of realizing any possibility they, or whoever they use this power on, are capable of. No matter how small or (seemingly) illogical the possibility, it will be realized so long as it is not 0%. Foes they can beat cannot defeat them unless allowed, those they can catch will never escape them, problems they can solve pose no difficulty.
