<p>The user can permanently wipe out the totality of existence itself. Every life, every death, every origin and every kind of creature whether mortal, extraterrestrial, divine or transcendental will go extinct. Every world, dimension, plane of reality, timelines, concepts, reality, entire universes, multiverses, the <a href="/wiki/Omniverse_Manipulation" title="Omniverse Manipulation">Omniverse</a> and <a href="/wiki/Omnilock" title="Omnilock">beyond</a> will pass away. And everything temporal, cosmic, spiritual, conceptual, supernatural, metaphysical, eldritch, natural, memories, genetics, principles, ideas/probabilities/possibility, name/definition, will be sent to oblivion. It doesn't matter what happens or who tries to interfere, all things will be successfully erased. Even the very act of creation/genesis and even <a href="/wiki/Grand_Design_Construction" title="Grand Design Construction">The Plan</a> itself will be all wiped clean forever.
