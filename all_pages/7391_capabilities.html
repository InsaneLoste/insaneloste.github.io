<p>The user can generate earthquakes at will, being able to manipulate seismic energy and geological forces, enabling them to induce earthquakes of varying magnitudes. They might be able to create tremors, ground-shaking vibrations, or full-scale destructive earthquakes depending on the extent of their power and control. The range and scale of the earthquakes generated could vary greatly, from localized rumbles to devastating global cataclysms.
