<ul><li>Since the user isn't <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Invulnerability" title="Invulnerability">invulnerable</a>, the user can only take so much damage before it finally takes effect. At best, the user will only be stunned by damage that would usually kill ordinary people.</li>
<li>If the power is due to mimicking an element, the user might become even more vulnerable than normal to certain attacks. Ex: Someone with <a href="/wiki/Metal_Mimicry" title="Metal Mimicry">Metal Mimicry</a> might be fragile towards someone with <a href="/wiki/Magnetism_Manipulation" title="Magnetism Manipulation">Magnetism Manipulation</a>, or a person with <a href="/wiki/Water_Mimicry" title="Water Mimicry">Water Mimicry</a> will be frail to those with <a href="/wiki/Electricity_Manipulation" title="Electricity Manipulation">Electricity Manipulation</a>.</li>
<li>Some powers that are capable of bypassing durability like <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">Telepathy</a>, <a href="/wiki/Peak_Human_Strength/Absolute" title="Peak Human Strength/Absolute">Absolute Strength</a>, <a href="/wiki/Durability_Negation" title="Durability Negation">Durability Negation</a>, etc., can be counteractive against this ability.</li>
<li>May have a set duration.</li></ul>
