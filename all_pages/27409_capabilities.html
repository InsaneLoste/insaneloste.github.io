<p>Users, either innately or through training, are masters of wielding whip katanas. They come in many forms, mainly a katana with a bladed whip, or a whip with sharp edges/extensions/protrusions. Users can utilize both short and long ranged attacks at various angles and make use of the katana's and flexible length to extend the reach of their attack such as turning corners to catch enemies off guards, or even entangle their opponents.
