Elves are humanoid beings who are either fairies, close relatives of the fairies, or humanoids with exceptional lifespans and magical inclination, depending on the lore. In general, elves resemble slender, beautiful, youthful/ageless, graceful humans. Some versions of elves are close to human size, others are diminutive, and still others are taller than humans. Though some human-sized elves could pass as <a href="/wiki/Archetype:Alpha_Human" title="Archetype:Alpha Human">particularly attractive humans</a>, most have one or more distinctly elven trait. Pointed ears are the most common, but some elves have large eyes, skin/hair/eyes of an unusual color, and/or (rarely in modern fiction, but not uncommonly in folklore) <a href="/wiki/Hollow_Being" title="Hollow Being">hollowed-out backs</a>.
