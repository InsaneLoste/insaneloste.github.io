<p>Users of this ability have denser/tougher bodily tissues than the average person. Their durability is at the peak of human conditioning, which entails that users are capable of withstanding situations/being mostly unharmed by things the average person cannot like getting beaten by a thick metal bat and it would dent and bend, fall from tall stories of buildings from 20-0 feet (9.14 m) without breaking any bones. They are also durable enough to survive brutal animal attacks, get hit by a train at full speed, and have an entire building collapse on top of them.
