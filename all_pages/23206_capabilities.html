<p>User can create or wield any kind of weaponry that has power over the space-time continuum, either as two separate weapons wielded simultaneously, two opposing elements in a single weapon, or a manipulation of both elements in a combined form, which grants the user a wide variety of spacetime-based abilities. This ability is not only specific to mystic weapons, but also technologically advanced weapons. The power of the weapons depends on what they were created for or what level of spacetime-derived ability they possess.
