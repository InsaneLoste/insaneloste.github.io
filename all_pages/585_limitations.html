<li>May be unable to create air/wind, being limited to manipulating only from already existing sources.</li>
<li>Distance, mass, precision, etc. depend upon the knowledge, skill, and strength of the user, and their power's natural limits.</li>
<li>Ineffective in a vacuum: atmosphere must be present.</li>
<li>Variations in air-pressure may complicate things for beginners.</li>
<li>Air user controls may have impurities (dust, pollen, spores, ash, fluorine, mercury, sulfur; also, meteoroids, ice granules, dead insects, small plant parts, oil and tint residues and vapor of liquid water).</li>
<li>May be weak against <a href="/wiki/Fire_Manipulation" title="Fire Manipulation">Fire Manipulation</a>, as fire is fueled by the oxygen in the air, thus making the flames stronger. Although if the user can learn to absorb all of said oxygen, they can put out the flames making this a partial limitation.</li>
<li>Higher-level <a href="/wiki/Electricity_Manipulation" title="Electricity Manipulation">Electricity Manipulation</a> users can use electrons to detonate the various compound molecules within the air, which may overwhelm the user.</li>
<li>Beings with <a href="/wiki/Thermal_Manipulation" title="Thermal Manipulation">Thermal Manipulation</a> can either increase or decrease the temperature of the air.</li>
<li>Air can be <a href="/wiki/Ice_Manipulation" title="Ice Manipulation">frozen</a>.</li></ul>
