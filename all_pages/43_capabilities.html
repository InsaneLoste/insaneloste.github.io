<p>The user can copy other abilities/powers and then imprint them into themselves or others, allowing them to make the powers a natural part of them. This makes it near impossible for them to forget or lose the powers after they have learned them, as trying to erase/remove an imprinted power would be the same as trying to remove or erase an arm or a leg.
