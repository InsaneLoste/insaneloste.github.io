<p>User can cause the target to damage themselves with every move, act or attack they may make when they are fighting or otherwise doing things. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Empathic_Masochism" title="Empathic Masochism">Empathic Masochism</a>, which inflicts damage to others by harming oneself, this power mainly just makes it so that the target will harm themselves when they are doing things in battle or otherwise.
