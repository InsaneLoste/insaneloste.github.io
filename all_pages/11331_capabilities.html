<p>Uses can fly, glide or levitate through manipulation of gravity. They can fly at varying speeds, levitate, or propel themselves without taking flight, including enhanced jumping by a short burst of flight. This can be achieved by gathering gravitational energies as a propulsion system, decreasing their gravitational pull/weight, and pulling their mass through the air while simultaneously repelling gravity.
