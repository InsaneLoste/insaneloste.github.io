<p>User is made up of or can transform their body completely into the twilight, a mixed essence between light and darkness. Users' transformed form either anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of twilight, in which case, it contains all organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
