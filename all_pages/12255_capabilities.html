<p>User is able to swing and otherwise suspend effortlessly fly and fall back and forward from such surfaces as branches, rocks, walls, etc. with their hands/body parts or a line/rope, as long as they can gain a hold of it and keep their balance. User is able to swing so much they can jump from one end to reach a certain distance and if not far enough the user can swing again and again to get to their location. This is normally done if the user has the ability to create/generate a substance that allows them to swing, rather than by swinging using something they did not create.
