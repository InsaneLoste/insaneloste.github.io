<p>The user has the ability to manipulate the “roles” of people in life, making reality comply with whatever that role entails. For example, a user could turn a target into an archetype called “the Hero”, altering reality around said target to change their lives into that of a hero's from epic storytelling. They could also turn someone into “the rival”, “the love interest”, “the follower”, etc. Each time the user changes a person to this role, reality alters accordingly to match whatever their role is. If the user turns someone or themselves into “the hero”, for example, they will face trials and tribulations according to the Hero’s Journey, and depending on the type of hero they turn themselves into, may become invincible to all but what they’re destined to fight against.
