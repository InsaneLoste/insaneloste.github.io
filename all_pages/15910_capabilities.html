<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate elements. Elements are the rudimentary, simplest or an essential part of which any material thing consists of. Elements are irreducible in nature and compose other (usually physical) things. Various combinations of elements can be used to create other things. For example, Ice could be thought of as a combination of Water and Air to produce a solid. The exact details of how elements combine, what each element does, and even which things are elements is canon/paradigm specific.
