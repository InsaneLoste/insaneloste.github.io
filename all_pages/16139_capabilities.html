<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Muldjewangk" title="wikipedia:Muldjewangk">Muldjewangk</a>. The Muldjewangk is a water-creature that inhabited the Murray River, particularly Lake Alexandrina. It was used as a deterrent for Aboriginal children who wished to play near the riverside after dark. Sometimes they are portrayed as evil merfolk, and other times as a gargantuan monster. It's unknown whether there are many of the creatures, or a single "The Muldjewangk".
