<p>The user is a Munuane, an orge-like creature from Colombian &amp; Venezuelan folklore. The Munuane is tall and powerful. His hair is long and grey, his mouth is toothless, and his eyeless, however his knees are his eyes. He is invulnerable to everywhere except his knees. He rafts the jungle waterways and owns all the fish in the jungle waters. The Munuane hates greed; he'll attack fisherman who overfishes. He is also an insatiable sexual predator with his victims turning into termites. Fortunately the Munuane isn't intelligent and can be easily outsmarted.
