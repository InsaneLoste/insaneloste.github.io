<p>User becomes a transdimensional crossroads runner capable of traversing great distances without the need of constitutional locomotion. Essentially moving incredibly fast (<b>femtosecond speed</b>) while not actually moving within any occupied area via dropping in and out between real and subspacial planes in rhythmic pulse intervals, at an incredibly rapid pace much faster than one can achieve though simple running, flying or even teleportation.
