<p>Users can touch objects and people without them feeling what the user does on them, whether it be the pain, pressure or temperature they exert on them. This makes it so that the user can walk on or even dance on the object or person without waking them up, or cause them to react via their reflexes. Plus, should the target be knocked away from the user, they would not know it due to not being able to feel it and only see that they are moving "somehow" in their eyes.
