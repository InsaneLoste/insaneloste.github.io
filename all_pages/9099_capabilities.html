<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aether_(classical_element)" title="wikipedia:Aether (classical element)">Aether</a>, a powerful and unique celestial element said to flow throughout the universe and existence, and also binds the four classical elements: <a href="/wiki/Water_Manipulation" title="Water Manipulation">water</a>, <a href="/wiki/Fire_Manipulation" title="Fire Manipulation">fire</a>, <a href="/wiki/Earth_Manipulation" title="Earth Manipulation">earth</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Air_Manipulation" title="Air Manipulation">air</a> together. Commonly recognized as the essence breathed by gods in the same way humans breathe air, Aether is a power and force that allows control over elemental, cosmic, spiritual, transcendental and primordial forces. Regarded as <a class="text" href="https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Divine_Force_Manipulation" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">divine power</a>, users that can control Aether are considered god-like, essentially becoming virtually invincible.
