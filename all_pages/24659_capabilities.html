<p>The user possesses tactile telekinesis, the power to move, manipulate or otherwise interact with matter and energy through mental effort or other means through physical contact. The differences between telekinesis and tactile telekinesis are their distance of influence. Normal telekinetics can move matter and objects from a distance without direct contact with the body; meantime, tactile telekinetics are restricted to manipulating what they're touching. The user cannot access telekinesis's most popular and essential applications that define it (<a href="/wiki/Attraction_%26_Repulsion" title="Attraction &amp; Repulsion">attraction &amp; repulsion</a>, <a href="/wiki/Telekinetic_Maneuver" title="Telekinetic Maneuver">telekinetic maneuver</a>, <a href="/wiki/Orbital_Field" title="Orbital Field">mass levitation fields</a>, etc.). Regarding manipulation from a distance, the user is constantly in contact with themselves. Hence, tactile telekinesis is considered a personalized variation of telekinesis, mainly because it's portrayed as users telekinetically manipulating themselves as they are cataloged as powers associated with oneself and cataloged as an object.
