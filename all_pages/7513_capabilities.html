<p>The user can utilize the Eldritch Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around Lovecraftian power. While most forms of supernatural ability and/or skill tend to be derived from some familiar source (elements, magic, psionics, etc.), eldritch practices are rooted in sources that defy the rules of nature/science. Whether the user is of eldritch origin, has been transformed into some type of abomination and/or possesses a unique connection to an abyssal power source, by engaging in special practices, one is able to wield various abilities that can defy logic and impose a godlike influence on oneâ€™s surroundings and targets. While the techniques (attacks, defense, regeneration, reality warping) can be potent, one must be careful to not be corrupted, destroyed and/or maddened by the powers being utilized.
