<p>The user is affected by forces at a faster rate and with more strength. With this, they can slow down easily or be able to control their movement in a much easier way by accelerating the gravity and friction that affects them. This power is the reason speedsters can perform super-fast actions (Ex. Take a jump, and the speed of the fall seems normal from the speedster's perspective) even though slow things like gravity should prevent it.
