<p>The user can gain powers through a symbiotic relationship with an Aether-based being (such as an <a href="/wiki/Aether_Embodiment" title="Aether Embodiment">embodiment</a> of the Aether or an entity that controls and/or is comprised of it). The bond between host and entity imparts power related to life-force, chi, mana and/or aura.
