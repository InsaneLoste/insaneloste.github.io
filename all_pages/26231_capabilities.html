<p>Users of this ability are either a member of an Undead Fairy group or can mimic the traits of them, in world folklore fairies come in three distinct kinds - the spirits of the dead, nature spirits and the more demonic spirits: the concept of fairies as undead creatures dates back to ancient times, related to ancestral worship - often these spirits are envisioned as spirits of humans, animals or even concepts that linger close to their ancient burial mounds and may bring misfortune to the living, other times they may actually be helpful but in general they were seen as neutral at best.
