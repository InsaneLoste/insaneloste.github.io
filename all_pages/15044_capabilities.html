<p>Users can control <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Griffin" title="wikipedia:Griffin">griffins</a>. Holders of this ability can order griffins to do various things, for example, summon them into battle to fight their enemies, or use them to infiltrate places that would normally be inaccessible to the user. Naturally, they could also communicate with them, read their thoughts and emotions and establish telepathic connections with them. More advanced users could create griffins out of thin air or even manipulate their genetic makeup and DNA to enhance their characteristics and qualities.
