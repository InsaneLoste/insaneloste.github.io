<p>User can deny the effects of any/all events, including those that are a part of the user's history. This allows you to ignore the effects of those events, such as an event from your past in that you were caught in a house fire and injured/scarred, with this you can deny the effects the event had on you allowing you to erase the scars as if they never happened.
