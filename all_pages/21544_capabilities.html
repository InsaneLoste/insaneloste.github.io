<p>The user can control over the <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moment_of_inertia" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">rotational mass</a>, the resistance to changes in something's rotation, which allows one to make it so something can rotate more easily or make it harder to rotate something. Rotational mass is not only dependent on mass, but distance from the axis of rotation. halving the distance reduces rotational mass by a fourth and doubling the distance quadruples the rotational mass.
