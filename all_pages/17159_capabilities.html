<p>The user can utilize the Object Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around object-based power. There are various types of powerful items that can grant their users supernatural abilities; however, properly wielding them to bring about desirable effects can still take considerable training and study. They can come in a variety of forms (accessories, apparel, tools, weapons, etc.), natures (inanimate, living, undead, etc.) and origins (divine, demonic, spiritual, elemental, etc.). In some cases, an individual may actually have an object-based physiology that allows them power associated with a particular item. By undergoing specialized training, one can learn to wield this itemized power to exhibit skills and techniques ranging from enhanced physical ability to energy manipulation to healing.
