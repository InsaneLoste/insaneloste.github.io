<p>Users are/can become a kasha. A kasha is a type of demonic cat-ghoul related to the bakeneko, but distinctive in behavior, appearance, and purpose. While not predatory in regards to the living, the kasha are ruthless in pursuit of the dead and will outright attack funerals so as to capture and devour the corpse.
