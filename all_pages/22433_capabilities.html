<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Shunobon or are one, Shunobon are fearsome demons (sometimes also referred to as yokai) who often terrorize humans wandering lonely roads, they will often appear as one-eyed monsters and cause victims to faint in fright, sometimes a victim will even outright die due to the sheer terror the Shunobon emits.
