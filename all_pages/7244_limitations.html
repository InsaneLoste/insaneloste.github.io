<ul><li>Despite gaining high resistance to "natural enemy ability", like dragon with high res against dragon slayer power, more powerful abilities can do damage.</li>
<li>If one of the natures gives the chance of living forever, that ability is nullified by the self age manipulation.</li>
<li>In extremely rare cases, a Dualis with an animal nature can go into "heat" for 9-10 days or a time that change based on the normal period of the animal, if the "urge" remains "unsatisfied" at the beginning, the dualis can become violent.</li>
<li>The new nature is not chosen by the Dualis or by the converted thing/being but is "chosen" by the ritual that analyzes the subject and "chooses" the most fit nature usng an "affinity system" (like wanting a Dragon nature and obtaining an Oni nature instead because the affinity with "Oni" is more strong than "Dragon").</li></ul>
