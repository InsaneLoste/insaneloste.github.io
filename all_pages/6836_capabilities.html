<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate holy divine metal that's highly effective against the supernatural, such as demons and/or angels. The effectiveness, in question, can range from <a href="/wiki/Binding" title="Binding">trapping and/or immobilizing</a> to outright <a href="/wiki/Banishment" title="Banishment">banishing</a> or <a href="/wiki/Death_Inducement" title="Death Inducement">killing</a> supernatural threats. Furthermore, divine metal itself is nigh-invulnerable by normal means like; melting, corrosion, etc, and may have other properties and abilities, such as <a href="/wiki/Healing" title="Healing">healing</a>, <a href="/wiki/Resurrection" title="Resurrection">Resurrection</a>, summoning <a href="/wiki/Angel_Physiology" title="Angel Physiology">angels</a> and/or spirits of the deceased from Heaven to the material plane.
