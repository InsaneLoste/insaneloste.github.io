<p>The user can change direction on a 360 degree axis. This means the user can change direction on a purely perpendicular (or oblique) direction along a direction of travel. So if the user is going forward, the user can go left, right, up, down or anywhere in between, but not backward or forward. This can also be used to "change lanes of travel".
