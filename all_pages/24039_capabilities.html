<p>The user can utilize the Subtle Body Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around the subtle body. There exists within the physical being a set of essences that are not entirely physical nor entirely mental and/or spiritual. There are many different types: astral form, etheric body, chakras, body meridians. They possess incredible power related to life-force, spiritual energy and pure thought. Learning about them can open up an entirely new perspective for students. Understanding how to harness their power adds new dimensions to oneâ€™s very being. Through esoteric training practices, users can attain specialized abilities related to the nature of a specific subtle body. As this essence is connected with and influences the physical form, mind and soul, one can gain various physiological (enhanced strength, heightened senses, regeneration), mental (ESP, enlightenment, psychic power) and spiritual (mediumship, existential plane access, ectoplasm) powers.
