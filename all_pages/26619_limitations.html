<li>Vampires need a constant supply of blood, and powers/abilities may weaken when they haven't feed for a while. (The older the vamp, the longer they can go without feeding)</li>
<li>Vampires supposedly have several and traditional weaknesses, but how effective these are to an individual vampire varies greatly:
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Trait:Light_Aversion" title="Trait:Light Aversion">Light Aversion</a></b>: Direct sunlight may cause instant <a href="/wiki/Disintegration" title="Disintegration">disintegration</a>, <a href="/wiki/Incineration" title="Incineration">burn</a> like fire or <a href="/wiki/Power_Negation" title="Power Negation">prevent</a> the use of supernatural powers. Originally, vampires had to sleep in their coffin during the day, and sunlight wasn't <i>fatal</i>, they were merely dormant during the day making it "easy" to sneak up on them.
<ul><li><a href="/wiki/Ultraviolet_Manipulation" title="Ultraviolet Manipulation">Ultraviolet</a> light may be especially effective.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Stabbed in the Heart/Stakes</b>: Wooden stake through the heart. In most modern depictions, this is fatal; in the original folklore, it merely stops the vampire from leaving their coffin. In most of the older stories, one had to use a hammer or a grave digger's shovel to drive the stake in, which meant that vampire staking mainly happened during the day when the vampire was asleep. In some cases, a special specimen of wood is needed for the stake to be effective, commonly Hawthorn, and occasionally it needs to be blessed or enchanted.
<ul><li>Some may die just by driving anything through the heart. This worked in the original folklore as they use to drive iron and steel through the heart.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Trait:Metal_Aversion" title="Trait:Metal Aversion">Metal Aversion</a>: Certain vampires have been known to be harmed and even killed by silver, especially stakes to the heart.</li></ul></li>
<li><b>Decapitation</b> - and as a bonus point, this one isn't exactly exclusive to vampires; it conveniently works on almost any supernatural creature, and humans too. Then again, so does a stake through the heart.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Trait:Holy_Aversion" title="Trait:Holy Aversion"><b>Holy Aversion</b></a>
<ul><li><b><a href="/wiki/Holy_Cross" title="Holy Cross">Crosses</a></b>: but not necessarily other religious symbols. In modern renditions, this is usually subject to the power of belief of the wielder, the vampire, both, or neither.
<ul><li>Possibly against <a href="/wiki/Category:Holy_Power" title="Category:Holy Power">Holy Powers</a>.</li></ul></li></ul></li>
<li>Certain plant life, alloys or substances, including bacteria; garlic or <a href="/wiki/Silver_Manipulation" title="Silver Manipulation">silver</a> being most common.</li></ul></li>
<li>As supernatural being they are force to follow <a href="/wiki/Supernatural_Law_Manipulation" title="Supernatural Law Manipulation">supernatural laws/rules</a> that governs their supernatural world.
<ul><li>May be unable to enter a dwelling without invitation.</li>
<li>May be bound to their coffin, earth/soil of their grave, etc. How often they need to be in contact of these and the consequences vary widely.</li>
<li>Running water acts like a barrier which, they can't cross, though this might be circumvented by making others transport them.</li></ul></li>
<li>If vampires and <a href="/wiki/Werewolf_Physiology" title="Werewolf Physiology">werewolves</a> are natural enemies, one may be vulnerable to their bite/scratch.</li>
<li><a href="/wiki/Conversion_Negation" title="Conversion Negation">Conversion Negation</a> may revert vampires to their original forms.</li></ul>
