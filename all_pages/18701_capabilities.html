<p>The user is capable of manipulating the weak nuclear force within their own body. As the interaction responsible for particle decay, it plays a major role in subatomic transmutations, nuclear fusion, and nuclear fission, notably the energetic emissions of stars, including the sun. By controlling this, one can manipulate various energetic/physical aspects of oneself from particle transmutation (neutrinos, positrons, etc.) to radiation emission.
