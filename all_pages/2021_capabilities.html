<p>User is made up of or can transform their body completely into an <i><a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Astronomical_object" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Astronomical object</a></i>, ie planets, stars, moons, constellations, galaxies etc. User can be anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of astronomical object (whether matter or energy), in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
