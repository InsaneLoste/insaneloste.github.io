<p>User exists “outside” of space and time and as such are immune to just about anything that would affect or harm them: if time should stop then the user will be unaffected. If space is switched with another one the user would still be unaffected. If reality would change, the user would remember both the previous and have knowledge of differences from the old to the new. If the area around the user explodes or the planet which they are on vanish or does not exist any more the user is not affected since they aren’t affected by the effects of space-time. Also some user may actually exist in another plane of existence where space-time doesn’t exist and also possibly even project themselves into reality by connecting their consciousness into a new body or instead will connect themselves to that spaceless and timeless space-time, although some and most users are indeed actually just really immune to Space-Time despite existing/residing where space-time does exist in.
