<p>User can create, shape and manipulate water of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Water Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiment of water. As such, they can cause natural water effects such as tsunamis, monsoons, and whirlpools to manifest. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Water Manipulation as water is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunity to water based abilities.
