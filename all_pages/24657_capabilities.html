<p>The user possesses a tactile-interactive variation of psionics. The difference between psionics and tactile psionics are a range of interaction; psionics has contact-based and long-distance-based psychic abilities, from psychokinesis, psychometry, molecular detection, etc. In comparison, tactile psionics possesses only touch-based powers or versions of any psionic ability. The user misses out on the benefits of using psionics from a distance (ex: preventing a nuclear accident kilometers away or saving a collapsing Brooklyn bridge). The user is restricted to employing psionic force onto matter, energy, or anything the user can come in contact with. However, the user essentially possesses a near-personalized variation of psionics due to dominating their psychic abilities onto themselves almost exclusively.
