<p>User can channel nature's energy and manipulate it for a myriad of purposes, channeling nature through their body and project it in a concentrated and powerful blast of light which seems to manifest as magical energy or a kinetic force, conclusively throwing or repelling objects a considerable distance. This power has been displayed to contain mysterious supernatural effects, such as breaking illusion and reversing/removing spells. Nature channeling is also the core feature of magic (such as Fae magic) and can be used for a number of purposes other than offensive blasts.
