<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pachydermata" title="wikipedia:Pachydermata">pachyderms</a>, thick-skinned animals that include elephants, rhinoceroses, tapirs, and hippos. They can command, speak/understand, evolve/devolve, merge with, possess, etc., with all forms of pachyderms. Weaker users can only influence their behavior, commanding them to do their bidding. <b>Note:</b> Scientifically speaking, the term <i>pachyderm</i> is an obsolete classification due to the various mammals having different evolutionary origins. Beyond strict biological terminology, the word is still used to describe creatures like elephants, rhinos and hippos.
