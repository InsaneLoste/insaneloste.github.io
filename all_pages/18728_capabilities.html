<p>The user is the source of absolute/perfect/primordial pestilence everywhere. Users being the binding existence together by the force/energy of pestilence, disease, and plagues are given instant and total dominion over all the powers of disease and plagues. As long as they exist all that is sickness does as well and everything connected to it. They are able to create, spread and manipulate all forms of afflictions. Anyone around them will become sicker and sicker.
