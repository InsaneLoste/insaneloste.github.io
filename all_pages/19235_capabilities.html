<p>User can create, shape and manipulate radioactive plasma on the low end of the EM Spectrum, using blood as a medium, and as such, is neither a solid, liquid or truly a gas even by transition phase standards. Plasma radiation is volatile and corrosive, capable of emitting low level EM Field to disrupt electrical fields, atomic bonds and physical/immaterial cohesion aside from disruptive Electromagnetic Pulses or Neutrino White Washing waves.
