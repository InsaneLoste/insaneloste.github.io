<p>The user is able to delay or make events come sooner. Here is how it works. When making events come sooner, the user practically moves the desired event that has yet to happen back in time. The moved event and all that follows will be "on top" of the events that are happening now and the events before the moved event happens. Both the moved and other event actually happen at the point in the timeline, so they are both remembered, but the events before the moved event will be "skipped", and though they still happen, they are not observed and visibly happen (though there are still recordings, footage and memories of those events) in favored to the events that have been made to come sooner. Time is also cut short when the event is moved.
