<p>The user can gain powers through a symbiotic relationship with a planet/planetary body. The host usually absorbs the energy of the planet or <a href="/wiki/Planetary_Embodiment" title="Planetary Embodiment">planetary embodiment</a> and uses it to enhance their abilities and/or wield supernatural powers. While it may be impossible to play vessel to an actual planet, one can house its essence for the user’s benefit, allowing for energy, elemental and matter manipulation powers based on the planet’s nature. Because of the symbiotic relationship between host and planet, both can benefit/suffer from each other’s state of being.
