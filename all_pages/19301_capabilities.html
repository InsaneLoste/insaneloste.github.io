<p>The user can manipulate pocket events, or events outside the timeline the user is in and can be used for training, simulation purposes, showing what happened before, what might have happened or might happen in the future, etc. Unlike pocket dimensions, these events last for an entire event, and can loop over and over again. They can be simulations of real life events, what-if events or original events altogether. Note that events in these pocket events, no matter how similar they are to those in the main timeline, cannot affect past and future events in the main timeline.
