<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a battery or batteries. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of batteries, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
