<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate the borders, or borders/barriers that separate the living world and the afterlife and move them. They can merge/divide afterlives or universes or parts of afterlives/universes, or crossover elements from different afterlives by removing their borders. They can shrink or enlarge afterlives, and manipulate the barriers so they become impassable or only passable to some.
