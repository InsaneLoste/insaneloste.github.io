<p>Users are absolutely immortal, and cannot die, age, get sick, be permanently wounded, are absolutely self-sustained and, as their <a href="/wiki/Mental_Continuation" title="Mental Continuation">mind</a> and <a href="/wiki/Eternal_Soul" title="Eternal Soul">soul</a> are as immortal as their <a href="/wiki/Unfettered_Body" title="Unfettered Body">biological bodies</a>, they are either <a href="/wiki/Psychic_Immunity" title="Psychic Immunity">immune to mental</a> and <a href="/wiki/Soul_Anchoring" title="Soul Anchoring">spiritual damage</a> or will always flawlessly recover from them. Any injuries the user suffers will immediately <a href="/wiki/Peak_Human_Regeneration/Absolute" title="Peak Human Regeneration/Absolute">heal</a>, even if the user's body is blown up, disintegrated or <a href="/wiki/Absolute_Destruction" title="Absolute Destruction">completely destroyed</a> to the sub-atomic level and even if the user is <a href="/wiki/Absolute_Erasure" title="Absolute Erasure">completely erased</a>, they will still <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Meta_Resurrection" title="Meta Resurrection">return to life</a>. Alternately, some users are absolutely <a href="/wiki/Flawless_Indestructibility" title="Flawless Indestructibility">immune to all harm</a>, and can never die from any causes. Either way, they are <a href="/wiki/Meta_Erasure_Immunity" title="Meta Erasure Immunity">unerasable</a>. The users completely <a href="/wiki/Death_Transcendence" title="Death Transcendence">transcend</a> the concept of death itself, though many users transcend <a href="/wiki/Life_and_Death_Transcendence" title="Life and Death Transcendence">both</a> the concepts of life and death.
