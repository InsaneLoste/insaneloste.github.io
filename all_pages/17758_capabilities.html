<p>The user's <a href="/wiki/Life-Force_Manipulation" title="Life-Force Manipulation">life-force</a> isn't similar to their species, resembling some other being's life-force, but they themselves are not that being. Their life-force can be mixed, bestial, of some other species, supernatural being or something completely else. While this grants them several powers/skills of the being their life-force is like, they keep their own species body.
