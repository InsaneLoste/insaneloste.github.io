<p>The user can defy/ignore the vacuum of outer space. Contrary to belief, the vacuum is not empty, as it can actually contain little matter, such as hydrogen and helium particles in it. Hitting these at high speed would cause problems and do damages to those travelling at such speed. With this power, however, the user does not have this problem. This will not work on true vacuums, which contain no matter at all.
