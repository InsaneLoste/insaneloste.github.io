Varying in shape, size, duration and damage, these blasts can often lack much <a href="/wiki/Bolt_Projection" title="Bolt Projection">precision</a> or <a href="/wiki/Beam_Emission" title="Beam Emission">focus</a> against individual targets but tend to possess <a href="/wiki/Wave_Emission" title="Wave Emission">wider amounts of range</a>.
