<p>The user can bring oneself and others <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Resurrection" title="wikipedia:Resurrection">back to life</a>.  While this power is similar to <a href="/wiki/Necromancy" title="Necromancy">necromancy</a> in that it raises the dead, resurrection is different in that it fully restores a creature's body, mind, <i>and</i> soul to full health.
