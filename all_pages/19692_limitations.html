<ul><li>UnlikeÂ <a href="/wiki/Power_Absorption" title="Power Absorption">Power Absorption</a>, the users are unable to steal the powers, just replicate them as their own. Whereas the former assimilates them which in turn causes the target to permanently/temporarily lose their abilities, the latter is not capable of doing such.</li>
<li>Cannot replicate <a href="/wiki/Omnipotence" title="Omnipotence">Omnipotence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Omnipresence" title="Omnipresence">Omnipresence</a>, <a href="/wiki/Omniscience" title="Omniscience">Omniscience</a> or other <a class="text" href="https://powerlisting.fandom.com/wiki/Omnipotence#Omnipotent_Abilities" rel="noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Omnipotent Powers</a>.</li>
<li>Despite the powers being replicated from other opponents, the powers will still have every single limitation that the abilities would possibly possess, for example, <a href="/wiki/Fire_Manipulation" title="Fire Manipulation">Fire Manipulation</a> is useless against <a href="/wiki/Fire_Immunity" title="Fire Immunity">Fire Immunity</a>.</li>
<li>Cannot copy the powers of users of <a href="/wiki/Power_Mimicry_Immunity" title="Power Mimicry Immunity">Power Mimicry Immunity</a>, <a href="/wiki/Power_Anchoring" title="Power Anchoring">Power Anchoring</a> or <a href="/wiki/Singularity" title="Singularity">Singularity</a>.

<li>Weak against <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Uniqueness" title="Uniqueness">Uniqueness</a></li></ul></li>
<li>Accumulation may cause a power overload.</li>
<li>Physical powers, like <a href="/wiki/Multiple_Hearts" title="Multiple Hearts">Multiple Hearts</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Fang_Retraction" title="Fang Retraction">Fang Retraction</a>, may be painful to replicate.</li>
<li>May only be able to copy a limited number of powers at a time, unless the user can overcome their limitations.</li>
<li>Does not work against <a href="/wiki/Replication_Negation" title="Replication Negation">Replication Negation</a>.</li>
<li>May need physical contact to mimic powers.</li>
<li>Unless the user has <a href="/wiki/Visual_Power_Replication" title="Visual Power Replication">Visual Power Replication</a>, may need eye contact to mimic powers.</li>
<li>May lose replicated powers and need to re-replicate again to retain them.</li>
<li>May not be able to replicate technology-based abilities, only to replicate the power to <a href="/wiki/Technology_Manipulation" title="Technology Manipulation">manipulate</a> it, unless they have <a href="/wiki/Object_Replication" title="Object Replication">Object Replication</a> or <a href="/wiki/Technology_Imitation" title="Technology Imitation">Technology Imitation</a>.</li>
<li>May not be able to choose what powers they can copy from their opponents. In short, the power in question will be quite unruly as it'll just simply copy every single power possible that the opponent or ally has.</li>
<li>May be permanent on the target and/or user, meaning they wouldn't be able to discard the powers as they choose to unless they possess <a href="/wiki/Power_Discarding" title="Power Discarding">Power Discarding</a>.</li>
<li>Higher-level powers may be more difficult to copy.</li>
<li>The current replicated power can be replaced if the user touches another person with powers.</li>
<li>Unless the user can <a href="/wiki/Weakness_Resistance" title="Weakness Resistance">resist</a>/<a href="/wiki/Limitation_Transcendence" title="Limitation Transcendence">overcome</a> their limitations, certain combinations of powers may be painful together.</li>
<li>May be unable to mimic copied/stolen powers.</li>
<li>May be unable to evolve/improve the power as the original user can unless they also have <a href="/wiki/Enhanced_Power_Replication" title="Enhanced Power Replication">Enhanced Power Replication</a>.</li>
<li>May not be effective if the opponent is using a different move or style.</li>
<li>May not be able to copy powers from different species unless user have <a href="/wiki/DNA_Replication" title="DNA Replication">DNA Replication</a> or <a href="/wiki/Genetic_Mimicry" title="Genetic Mimicry">Genetic Mimicry</a>.</li>
<li>May not be able to copy powers from different sources.</li></ul>
