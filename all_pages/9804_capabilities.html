Finfolk are a type of malevolent ocean-entity found in Orkney Islands folklore. They were described as a tribe of sorcerers and shapeshifters who were skilled at boating and who could bend the ocean to their will. Finfolk could live underwater or on land, though their true home was a large city at the bottom of the ocean. They would raid towns and villages to steal humans as husbands or wives.
