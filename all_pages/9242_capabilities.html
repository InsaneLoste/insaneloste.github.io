<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exotic_matter" title="wikipedia:Exotic matter">exotic matter</a>, form of matter with "exotic properties". Exotic matter can be matter with "exotic" physical properties that defy the known laws of physics, such as tachyons, that have negative mass or "imaginary" mass, allowing them to either reverse the laws of physics or simply go faster than the speed of light. It can also be hypothetical particles that have capabilities well within the laws of physics, states of matter that aren't commonly encountered, like <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quark%E2%80%93gluon_plasma" title="wikipedia:Quark–gluon plasma">quark-gluon plasma</a> or <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bose%E2%80%93Einstein_condensate" title="wikipedia:Bose–Einstein condensate">Bose-Einstein condensates</a>, or they can be states of matter poorly understood like dark matter, or normal matter placed under high pressure.
