<p>The user either is or can become an <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/%C5%8Cny%C5%ABd%C5%8D" title="wikipedia:Ōnyūdō">onyudo</a>, a yokai that takes the form of a giant monk. Their name has the meaning of "big monk," but depending on area, there are various legends where their actual appearance is that of an unclear shadow, simply a giant rather than a monk, among others. The ones that look like a monk (bōzu) are also called ōbōzu. In size, there are those that are about two meters tall, slightly larger than that of a human, to giants that about the size of a mountain.
