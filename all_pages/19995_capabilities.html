<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate Ice of an ancient primordial nature. As opposed to regular Ice Manipulation, users of this power are deities, avatars, or living embodiments of ice. As such, they can cause natural Ice effects such as avalanches, blizzards, and hail storms to occur. In many cases users of this power will be able to override other forms of Ice Manipulation as ice is the domain of the user. Similar to other primordial elements, the raw potency and primeval nature of this power enables the user to easily overpower immunities &amp; resistances to ice &amp; cold-based abilities.
