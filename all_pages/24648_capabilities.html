<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tachyon" title="wikipedia:Tachyon">tachyons</a>, a hypothetical particle that always moves faster than light. Just as an ordinary particle such as an electron can exist only at speeds less than that of light, a tachyon can exist only at speeds greater than that of light. At such speeds, its mass would be real and positive, on losing energy, a tachyon accelerates; the faster it travels, the less energy it has.
