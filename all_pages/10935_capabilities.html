<p>Users of this power can take on the powers of or become Glashtyn, mythical water-goblins from the folk tales of Manx and are often envisioned as horse-like creatures that were prone to shape-shifting (often becoming a hybrid of human and horse).  Like many water-horses, they were dangerous to humans and had an especially nasty habit of harassing lone women.
