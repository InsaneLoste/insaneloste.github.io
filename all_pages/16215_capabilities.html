<p>User has or can grow more than one head. This allows them to see on more direction than one and increases their sensory acuity, if they have abilities that allow them to attack using their head (<a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Powerful_Bite" title="Powerful Bite">bite</a>, <a href="/wiki/Breath_Powers" title="Breath Powers">breath-weapon</a>, etc.), they are able to use all their heads to do so.
