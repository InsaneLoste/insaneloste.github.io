<p>User emits a passive or active illusion-based defense/aura. This ability functions as an aura/defense around the user, tricking enemy senses and their abilities into thinking the attack has been blocked (passively making enemies manipulate their attack around the user's defense) or actual defenses if the user is able to harden their illusions. This ability seeks to confuse and misdirect opponent efforts to kill the user.
