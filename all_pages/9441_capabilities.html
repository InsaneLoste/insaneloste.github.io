<p>A user with this ability either is or can transform into a faery vampire, a hybrid of a vampire and any type faerie which is capable of using all the powers of both species and for centuries (in most cases) it was thought such a combination could not exist. If the change is successful, they become more powerful as they age and in terms of both their fae and vampiric abilities they are immune to sunlight and invitation. The fae side also seems to render them capable of consuming ordinary food and beverages (something vampires cannot do themselves). As a creature who has the physical powers of a vampire, and the magical powers of a fairy, they are extremely powerful and dangerous monsters, and can be rivaled by few other beasts such as Vaewolves.
