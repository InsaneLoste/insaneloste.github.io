<p>The user can perform a multiplying dash, meaning the dash doubles, triples, etc. in magnitude within any duration of time (like half a second to a full second), all done in one, single dash. In other words, the user goes faster dash-wise for every specified amount of time. The multiplying of the dash may be done any number of times (though usually a small number like three or five) after the dash is initiated. After the multiplying finishes, the dash itself finishes. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Infinite_Dash" title="Infinite Dash">Infinite Dash</a>, which has the user do more than one dash, this power has the user's dash multiply within one dash alone.
