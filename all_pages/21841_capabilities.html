<p>User, either innately or through training, is a master of wielding classroom or school utilities, such as rulers, pencils, <a href="/wiki/Scissors_Proficiency" title="Scissors Proficiency">scissors</a>, pens, sometimes books, school paper, etc. They can use the weapons as they are a part of them and mostly these tools are used for stabbing and can make cuts and wounds deep enough to paralyze or kill, depending on where the place. Though weak on defensive plays, the user is mostly strong in and on offensive plays and good in range by throwing mostly pencils and pens, almost acting as bullets from guns or arrows from a bow.
