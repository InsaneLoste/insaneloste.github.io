<p>Users can create a field that draws in any objects within the surrounding area towards oneself. Unlike regular <a href="/wiki/Attraction_%26_Repulsion" title="Attraction &amp; Repulsion">attraction &amp; repulsion</a>, the field provides little to no precise control over what they pull towards its center, and oftentimes is unable to accurately pull singular or specific items or even how much force is applied to the object, which can lead to some objects being violently dragged towards the user. Instead, they pull things to them from a certain radius, with size and mass being more of a factor.
