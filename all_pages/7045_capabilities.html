<p>Users can create, shape, manipulate, and destroy dragons. They control them to do their bidding, helping them during situations, using them against foes, and using them to see locations and gather information about a particular place. Some can see through the dragons' eyes that are controlled allowing them to attack others. Users can also understand or communicate with them, hence creating and strengthening friendships. More advanced users could create dragons out of thin air or even manipulate their genetic makeup and DNA to enhance their characteristics and qualities.
