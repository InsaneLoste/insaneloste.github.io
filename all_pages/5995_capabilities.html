<p>User can remove the death of anyone or anything, including all aspects of death, forcing them to stay alive regardless of pain, infirmity, medical conditions or anything else. Even when someone is supposed to have died they would remain alive, but would continually rot and decay from the inside until they are rendered immobile, but they will still remain alive and conscious, regardless.
