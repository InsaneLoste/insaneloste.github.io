<p>The user can generate and manipulate <a href="/wiki/Water_Manipulation" title="Water Manipulation">water</a> that carries an <a href="/wiki/Electricity_Manipulation" title="Electricity Manipulation">electric current</a> at all times or both water and electricity simultaneously. This allows a user to both cause splashing and electric damage to foes. A user can also create and manipulate storm clouds (as clouds are a mass of water droplets) and possibly use it to fly or propel themselves in the air. Controllers can also control water in its plasma state.
