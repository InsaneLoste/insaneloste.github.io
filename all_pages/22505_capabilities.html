Originally described as a dog-bird, peacock with feathers the color of copper, with the head of a dog and the claws of a lion â€“ later it was shown with either the head of a man or a dog. It is gigantic enough to carry off an elephant or a whale. Being part mammal, she suckles her young and has teeth.
