<p>User can open a hole in the universe connecting two non-adjacent locations. This may be done in a very neat manner, such as connecting two doorways in the universe, or it may be done very sloppily like breaking a rift in the space-time continuum. They may use <a href="/wiki/Dimensional_Manipulation" title="Dimensional Manipulation">Dimensional Manipulation</a> to tear a tiny hole through two universes, use <a href="/wiki/Spatial_Manipulation" title="Spatial Manipulation">Spatial Manipulation</a> to overlap two points in the universe or a wormhole connecting those two points. This is another form of teleportation. The user can create a portal that also allows them to teleport alongside people or direct their attacks.
