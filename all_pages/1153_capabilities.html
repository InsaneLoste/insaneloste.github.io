<p>The user has access to the magical energies, powers, <a href="/wiki/Spell_Casting" title="Spell Casting">spells</a>, <a href="/wiki/Potion_Creation" title="Potion Creation">potions</a>, <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Mystic_Object" title="Mystic Object">objects</a>, and various other magical items only unique to their family bloodline and even other close members of the users family in some cases, allowing the user to use those supernatural forces to varying degrees, with only their skill, personal power-level, imagination/knowledge, and/or morality to define the borders. Unfortunately though, there is a lot less flexibility to this form of magic if abused, especially if the source of its powers (the spiritual ancestors of the user) decide to turn/take the users magic off/back, or they can expand the users magical power, which can be essentially limitless with possibilities for what they can accomplish if the user continues do as their ancestors approve of them.
