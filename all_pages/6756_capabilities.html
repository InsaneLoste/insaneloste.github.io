<p>The user has the ability to bend or deform anything the user has on or is inside of without breaking it, via mass, size or elasticity altering. An example would be having the user in a small bag, barely fitting in, and when the user moves their limbs inside the bag, they cause the parts of the bag affected by the limbs to stretch, add in mass to become bigger or just cause those parts to get bigger so that their limbs can move in full range, even inside the bag.
