<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Uranium" title="wikipedia:Uranium">uranium</a>, a silvery-white, weakly radioactive metal. It is malleable, ductile, slightly paramagnetic, strongly electropositive, and a poor electrical conductor. Uranium reacts with almost all non-metal elements (except for the noble gases) and their compounds, increasing reactivity with temperature. When finely divided, it can react with cold water; uranium metal becomes coated with a dark layer of uranium oxide in the air. It also exists in bones and liver.
