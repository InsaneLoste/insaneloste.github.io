<p>Users with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Yuki-onna" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Yuki-onna</a> (snow woman), a yokai who is either the ghost of someone who perished in the snow or a personification of winter and snow. Yuki-onna appears on snowy nights as a tall, beautiful woman with long black hair and blue lips, with inhumanly pale or even transparent skin that let them blend into the snowy landscape. Despite her inhuman beauty, her eyes can strike terror into mortals. She floats across the snow, leaving no footprints (in fact, some tales say she has no feet, a feature of many Japanese ghosts), and can transform into a cloud of mist or snow if threatened.
