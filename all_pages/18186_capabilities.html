<p>User is not limited to just the average range of enhanced hearing, they can hear everything that goes on in the world, or the entire galaxy, or even the entire universe. They can do more than just hear everything that goes on, they can even hear the thoughts of anyone and everyone (not to be confused with <a href="/wiki/Telepathy" title="Telepathy">Telepathy</a>) as well as being able to bypass time itself and hear the past and future. Most importantly, they can filter auditory information to the most perfect precision as much as they want so they are not necessarily forced to hear everything all at once if they can't handle the input.
