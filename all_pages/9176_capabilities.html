<p>User can replicate and catalog the powers and abilities of another's and evolve them in different way. For example, the user could replicate <a href="/wiki/Water_Manipulation" title="Water Manipulation">Water Manipulation</a> and turn it into a <a href="/wiki/Water_Form_Manipulation" title="Water Form Manipulation">Water Form Manipulation</a>. The user can also “branch out” with these powers, changing them into something else marginally related to it or turning it into something less advanced or powerful. An example would be replicating <a href="/wiki/Fire_Manipulation" title="Fire Manipulation">Fire Manipulation</a> and turning it into a <a href="/wiki/Energy_Fire_Manipulation" title="Energy Fire Manipulation">Energy Fire Manipulation</a> or vise versa.
