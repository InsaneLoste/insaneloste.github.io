<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of wielding <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chainsaw" title="wikipedia:Chainsaw">chainsaws</a>, portable gasoline-, electric-, or battery-powered saws that cut with sets of teeth attached to rotating chains driven along guide bars. They are used in activities such as tree felling, limbing, bucking, pruning, cutting firebreaks in wildland fire suppression, and harvesting of firewood. Chainsaws with specially designed bar-and-chain combinations have been developed as tools for use in chainsaw art and chainsaw mills. Specialized chainsaws are used for cutting concrete during construction developments.
