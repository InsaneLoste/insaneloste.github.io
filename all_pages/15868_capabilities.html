<p>Users of this ability are able to switch between two or more modes. A mode is a state that the user, or their equipment, may enter or switch between which provide different powers, abilities, talents, and sometimes even physiologies, to each other. Modes can be used to optimize the use of particular powers, or for optimal performance of particular tasks/scenarios. Mode switching may be accompanied by <a href="/wiki/Personal_Appearance" title="Personal Appearance">appearance alternation</a> or <a href="/wiki/Multiple_Forms" title="Multiple Forms">changed form</a>. Modes may also amplify aspects of a physiology or even activate latent aspects of a physiology, but they generally do not change a physiology from one to another. Users' personality may change as well.
