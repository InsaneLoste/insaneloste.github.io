<p>The user can change the events in the past, which immediately affects the events in the future and vice versa based on each decision made in the present via causality of the fourth dimension. By linking individual periods and causing actions in the past to directly alter the future, this power may also cause any changes in the future to have similar effects to events set in the past, such as <a href="/wiki/Quantum_Paradox_Inducement" title="Quantum Paradox Inducement">temporal paradoxes</a> where things in the environments start to freeze around residents present in them.
