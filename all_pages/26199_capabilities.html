<p>The user can defy the principle of uncertainty, doing things such that they could not otherwise do as if the uncertainty principle were not there. This principle is based on the wave-particle duality of matter. This allows the user to measure or calculate exactly, both the position and the momentum of an object. Thanks to this the user can affect and alter quantum mechanics.
