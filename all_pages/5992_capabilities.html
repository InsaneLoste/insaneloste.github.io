<p>The user can prevent the death of others from occurring, either by preserving their lives or preventing injuries/wounds from getting worse or festering. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Death_Negation" title="Death Negation">Death Negation</a> the targets are not rendered immortal or invulnerable, and can still be harmed as easily as anyone else, they just won't die by unnatural means like murder or accidents, just by natural death.
