<p>The user can gain powers by symbiotically hosting or linking to an alchemy-based/alchemic force being. The entity can come in a variety of forms. It can be a alchemically-altered or empowered being (such as a <a href="/wiki/Homunculus_Physiology" title="Homunculus Physiology">homunculus</a>). It can be an existence that has specialized control and/or dominion over certain powers (life creation, potion-making, transmutation, etc.). It could even be an embodiment of alchemy itself. In connecting to this entity, the host is capable of exhibiting potent abilities related to Hermetic disciplines, depending on its overall nature. The powers can be as simple and materialistic as manipulating raw matter to highly specialized and disciplined like creating artificial life forms or substances like the <a href="/wiki/Philosopher%27s_Stone_Manipulation" title="Philosopher's Stone Manipulation">philosoper's stone</a> to existential and transformative like personal evolution. The combined essences of magic and science that make up alchemy enable the host to take on a state of being greater than one normally could through linking with beings that are solely magical or scientific.
