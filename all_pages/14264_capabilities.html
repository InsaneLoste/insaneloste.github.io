<p>The user can utilize the Liminality Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around liminal power. Liminality refers to the threshold aspect that separates two distinct phases. Traditionally, this refers to rites of passage in which the initiate occupies an in-between space between their previous designation and their transformed state. On a larger scale, liminality can be used to describe grander degrees of reality, including architecture (passageways and paths), time periods and events (twilight, solstices), supernatural locations (Limbo, Purgatory) and even intermediate beings (ghosts, shapeshifters). Through training, an acolyte can gain abilities related to the nature of liminality.
