<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Atom" title="wikipedia:Atom">Atoms</a>, the smallest part of a chemical element that can retain its chemical identity (Atom can measure from 270 to 20 Picometers), and objects that form molecules. It is the basic unit of matter. The majority of an atom is concentrated with its nucleus, surrounded by one or more electrons, followed by protons and neutrons forming the nucleus of an atom. Every state and category of physical matter is a conclusion of electrons interacting with the atom. The amount of protons determines the chemical element of the atom. The number of neutrons determines the isotope of the chemical element. An atom interacts with the electromagnetic force due to the electrons and the nuclear force because of the nucleus. Due to repelling of the electromagnetic force and nuclear force, this proceeds into radioactive decay and nuclear transmutation. Atoms are responsible for chemical bonding, which governs nearly all of chemistry. By manipulating atoms, users can manipulate chemistry, elements, nuclear power, and control matter at an atomic level.
