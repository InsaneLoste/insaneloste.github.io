<p>User can create, shape, and manipulation <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Utopia" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Utopias</a>, realities where probabilities constantly adjust for the happiness of all living things, where every life is cared for and has its needs met and is free of suffering, and all work and live together in harmony. Allowing them to decide what belongs and what doesn't, how to satisfy the needs and happiness of others, fix any flaws or conditions that would detract or ruin the paradise, perfectly decide the best roles for everything living there, and etc.
