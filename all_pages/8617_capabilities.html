<p>Users, either innately or through training, are masters of wielding combat shoes. They are able to wield such shoes with great proficiency in brutal fist fights and hand-to-hand combat features, allowing them to fight on equal terms with larger and/or stronger opponents, or those holding larger weapons. Some users can savagely beat and pummel their opponent, and even slash them if their shoes are bladed. Some are also able to kick their shoes off to hit an opponent from a far distance.
