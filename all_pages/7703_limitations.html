<ul><li>Users of <a href="/wiki/Electricity_Resistance" title="Electricity Resistance">Electricity Resistance</a> are highly resistant and users of <a href="/wiki/Electrical_Immunity" title="Electrical Immunity">Electrical Immunity</a> are not affected.</li>
<li>Distance, force, precision, etc. depend upon the knowledge, skill, and strength of the user and their power's natural limits.</li>
<li>Electricity needs a conductor like water with electrolytes dissolved in it or metal to move through, therefore electricity can neither exist in nor move through a vacuum (such as outer space).</li>
<li>May be unable to create electricity, being limited to manipulating only from already existing sources.</li>
<li>Electricity may be redirected by certain materials.</li>
<li>A strong enough magnetic force/source may be beneficial or a hindrance.</li>
<li>May be limited only to the path of least resistance.</li>
<li>May become useless if insulated with non-conductive matter, such as <a href="/wiki/Rubber_Manipulation" title="Rubber Manipulation">rubber</a>, <a href="/wiki/Silicon_Manipulation" title="Silicon Manipulation">silicate</a>, <a href="/wiki/Air_Manipulation" title="Air Manipulation">air</a> etc. although a strong enough electrical change can overload any insulator and force it to become conductive.</li>
<li>May have to find electrical sources of power in order to recharge.</li>
<li>May have problems using electronics.</li>
<li>May be short-circuited under certain conditions:
<ul><li>Contact with <a href="/wiki/Water_Manipulation" title="Water Manipulation">water</a>, a magnet, the opposite polarity, etc.</li>
<li>Absence/lack of electrical resistance between the positive and negative polarities.</li></ul></li>
<li>Weak against <a href="/wiki/Electricity_Negation" title="Electricity Negation">Electricity Negation</a>.</li></ul>
