<p>The user is made up of or can transform their body completely into multiversal forces. Users can be anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of multiversal forces, in which case, it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogenous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
