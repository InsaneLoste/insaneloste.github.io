<p>Users can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electricity" title="wikipedia:Electricity">electricity</a>, a form of energy resulting from the movement of <a href="/wiki/Charged_Particles_Manipulation" title="Charged Particles Manipulation">charged particles</a> (such as <a href="/wiki/Electron_Manipulation" title="Electron Manipulation">electrons</a> or <a href="/wiki/Positive_Electricity_Manipulation" title="Positive Electricity Manipulation">protons</a>). As an elemental power, electricity manipulation is very simple and straightforward accompanied with a near-limitless myriad of uses. Most commonly, users would be able to discharge large amounts of electricity in order to shock their opponents, potentially paralyzing them, burning them, or even stopping their hearts in severe cases. Beware accidentally harming allies if the user's control over electricity is not precise enough. Some users would also be able to <a href="/wiki/Lightning_Summoning" title="Lightning Summoning">summon lightning bolts</a>, while even stronger users can <a href="/wiki/Lightning_Manipulation" title="Lightning Manipulation">manipulate it within the skies</a>, or even <a href="/wiki/Thunderstorm_Creation" title="Thunderstorm Creation">create thunderstorms</a> at will. Even if their opponent is <a href="/wiki/Electricity_Resistance" title="Electricity Resistance">resistant to electricity</a>, the immense heat generated from lightning traveling through the sky, which is around 6 times hotter than the surface of the sun, will definitely pose a threat to them.
