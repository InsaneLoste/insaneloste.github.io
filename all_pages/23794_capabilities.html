<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steam_engine" title="wikipedia:Steam engine">steam power</a>, the process involving the application of steam pressure to enable mechanical operations. When water is heated, it changes from liquid to gas, becoming steam. The steam can then be put under pressure, which will generate kinetic energy. The energy can be used to operate various mechanical and technological devices like engines and vehicles. The process is similar to the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fluid_power" title="wikipedia:Fluid power">fluid power</a> operations of hydraulics and pneumatics, which involve liquids and gases respectively; however, it differs in that material starts out as a liquid, is exposed to heat, turns into a gas and is pressurized to trigger mechanical operations. As such, this is often classified as a different type of power-generating procedure.
