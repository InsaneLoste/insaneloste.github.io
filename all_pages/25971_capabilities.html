<p>The user can create, shape, and manipulate illusions so powerful that they outweigh reality. They can induce illusions they can think of into people, objects, and themselves, and freely shift the phenomenon from illusion to reality and vice versa at any moment. They can change people, places, locations, rooms, and events, bring anything forth out of nowhere, make anything vanish without a trace, etc. The user can alter reality anytime they want in any way they want without a limit through illusions themselves.
