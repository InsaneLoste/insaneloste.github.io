<p>The wielder, either innately or through training, is a master of the use of blunted implements; objects, or tools that have been used since the most ancient of times, for the sole purpose of applying heavy blunt force trauma, either for construction, demolition, or combat. The wielder has reached a level of mastery that allows for relative ease in the dispatching of foes, whether they are of equal, or possibly greater strength. They are able to perform impressive feats such as halting, deflecting, or destroying large projectiles, bashing through incredibly tough objects or barriers, and have the strength needed to employ wide, sweeping strokes, to attack many enemies at once. They may also be proficient in the wielding of blunted throwing weapons, possibly adding ranged attacks to their repertoire.
