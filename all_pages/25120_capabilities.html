<p>User can trap anyone or anything into a reiterating time stream where everything inside the loop is restarted precisely every so often, possibly even backwards. They may be able to force someone to relive the same minute, hour, day, week, month, year, etc. for as long as the user keeps them there. On some occasions people have been known to retain a small number of memories or eventually escape weaker temporal loops.
