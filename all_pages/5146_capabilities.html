<p>User can create, shape and manipulate corporeality, or how abstract/concrete something is. Concrete is what can be perceived by the senses while abstract is what cannot be sensed, such as concepts, states, events, etc. They can turn a concrete existence into an abstract one, or vice versa, and manipulate the boundary between abstract and concrete existence.
