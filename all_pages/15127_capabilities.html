<p>Users can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mass" title="wikipedia:Mass">mass</a>, the amount of matter in a physical body, either of themselves or other people or objects. By doing so, they can freely dictate the force (F = <b>m</b>a), weight (W = <b>m</b>g), density (ρ = <b>m</b>/v), kinetic energy (KE = 1/2 <b>m</b>v<sup>2</sup>), and gravitational potential energy (GPE = <b>m</b>gh) of bodies by increasing or decreasing mass to achieve the desired effect.
