<p>The user can reduce the speed of objects/organisms to the point of them becoming immobile. This produces similar effects to time stopping, and the user can freeze specific targets, parts of a target, or immobilize the molecules within their surroundings. As with time-stop, the consciousness of an affected organism is immobilized, which causes them to be unaware of any event that transpired while the user had frozen them. But, unlike the time-stopping power, the timeline or the space-time around is not immobilized, only matter is stopped.
