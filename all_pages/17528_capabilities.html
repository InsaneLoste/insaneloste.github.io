<p>User with this ability can manifest onomatopoeic words as actual physical effects. They could charge a spoken onomatopoeia (e.g., boom, bam, pop) with explosive force. In addition, one could charge a spoken onomatopoeia (e.g., zap, crackle, fizz) to project with electrical power, at will. Furthermore, one can use animal onomatopoeias (e.g., cow's 'moo', cat's 'meow', dog's 'bark', frog's 'croak') to perfectly imitate that animal's voice. One could also target specific matter with onomatopoeias (e.g., 'crack' to break a glass window, 'whack' to induce blunt trauma on a foe, 'click' to disarm a lock). One could even potentially channel power from others' spoken onomatopoeias.
