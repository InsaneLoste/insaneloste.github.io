<p>The user can utilize the Double-Edged Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around two-sided power. Might, knowledge and skill can be acquired through training, often without incurring any major negative effects. Sometimes, however, that is not enough. There are specialized regimens and techniques that allow one to gain particularly potent abilities, but they carry risks with them. The benefits that come from the training (elemental power, spiritual force, psychic ability) can be as numerous as the detriments. They can range from temporary effects on the body like weakness or senselessness to self-inflicted damage caused by use to permanent consequences up to and including powerlessness, corruption or even death. Properly understood and mastered, one can potentially wield the Double-Edged Arts without having suffer too much; however, the threat to oneâ€™s very being, whether through carelessness or inherent nature, will always be present.
