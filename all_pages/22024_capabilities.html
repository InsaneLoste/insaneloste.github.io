<p>User is simultaneously both weighted and weightless, allowing them to have both physical mass/weight and no physical mass/weight at once. As such they can do things like walk on quicksand without falling through or walk on pressure traps without triggering them because they have no physical weight but they can also knock things over or carry things that weigh more than enough to weigh them down or knock them over without affecting their surroundings.
