<p>The user is the avatar or incarnation of a divine being. They hold a deep-rooted connection to the being and may be able to use its diverse powers as their own. Unlike Godly Incarnation, the divine being in question may or may not be omnipotent, monotheistic or the “one true god” incarnate. In fact, divine avatars can be either partial or complete, depending on the being. These avatars have definite purposes which revolve around the welfare of the universe.
