<p>The user can move, act and attack in ways otherwise not possible, all while time is frozen or a force or other thing affecting the user, such as gravity, friction and momentum, is stopped or ceases to work properly. This allows things such as moving through the air as if flying or stepping on it to walk, all because time or anything else is frozen or stopped and the forces can't really affect the user.
