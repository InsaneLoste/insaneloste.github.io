<p>Users can manipulate infinity, whether it'd be the concept itself or anything that is infinite. For example, they can swap, copy, transfer, steal, reassign, remove traits that are infinite and do more, and they can control how objects with infinite traits interact with other objects of infinite traits, such as how an irresistible force interacts with an unbreakable, immovable or unstoppable object.
