<p>The user can negate both cause and effect. This allows the user to achieve any desired effect by negating someone or something's cause and/or effect. By negating cause the user can erase effect allowing the user to negate time to a degree. By negating effect the user can either travel backwards in time to the point of cause or can remain in current point in time. Although the latter option leaves the user susceptible to the changes in time they can simply negate the effects the changes have on them.
