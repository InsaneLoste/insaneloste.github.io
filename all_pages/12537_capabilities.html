<p>The user is a unique type of immortal. Though they can be hurt and killed, and usually age normally, they will immediately be reborn as a child. Their new form may or may not be identical to the original body, but usually have the memories of their past lives, and rather than being reborn, they may instead simply appear or grow from nothing.
