<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a fairy dragon or an actual hybrid of fairy and dragon. This type of dragon is normally smallÂ with a fur covered skin and fairy-like wings (hence the name <i>Fairy Dragon</i>), and eat fruits, root, vegetables and/or insects. Fairy dragons can be powerful if allowed to use their abilities in full, which includes the power to induce confusion and euphoria in foes, and are also specialized in certain magics, which differs among each Fairy Dragon.
