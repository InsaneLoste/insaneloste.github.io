<p>Users can create, shape, and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blood" title="wikipedia:Blood">blood</a>, an essential <a href="/wiki/Bodily_Fluid_Manipulation" title="Bodily Fluid Manipulation">body fluid</a> in humans and other animals that delivers necessary substances such as nutrients and oxygen to the cells and transports metabolic waste products away from those same cells. The majority of users are only able to exert control over the blood of themselves, using them for various purposes, such as for rituals, examining, or most commonly combat. They can shape their blood into tendrils to strike enemies from afar or use it to trap opponents in a prison of blood. Users can concentrate blood into a single point, and shoot it out akin to bullets, or sharpen their blood to the point that they can slice and tear flesh with ease or solidify blood to use as rock-hard ammunition.
