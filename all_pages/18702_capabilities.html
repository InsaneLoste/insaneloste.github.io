<p>The user possesses their own, personalized weapon or an arsenal of weapons that are designed or chosen specifically for the user; they can be made of normal or supernatural materials. Because these weapons are tailored to user, they can't be stolen, lost, sold; they just re-materialize back to the user. The user can materialize their weapons whenever they need to and can even swap between different types of weapons to fit the situation.
