<p>The user is a "jack of all stats", a character who's skills are explicitly average and do not specialize in any one area. They're strong, fast, and tough, but not the strongest, fastest, or toughest; effectively, they're good at everything, the best at nothing, which makes them useful in most scenarios they will encounter.
