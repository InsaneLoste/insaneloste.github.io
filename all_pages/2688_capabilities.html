<p>The user can bio-energetically absorb, store, transfer, change, diminish, amplify, supercharge and/or transmute pure energy into another form, physical matter, or into a state which is both and neither. They can do this transmutation process in reverse to transmute matter into energy. Essentially, the inverse is control over mass-energy conversion.
