<p>User can mentally manipulate others to attack them with just their words and/or actions, regardless of the intentions, interests, ability, etc., of the target. This allows them to control the attention and actions of others on a scale from a single individual to enormous hordes of enemies, preventing them from doing anything else but attack the user, possibly inciting anger/aggression in their targets as well.
