<p>This power allows the user to turn people into dolls, even toys, puppets or action figures, including plastic, plush, wood, etc., or all have gadgets and devices implanted on them. Puppets retain some of their physical appearances, but they may not be able to move so they cannot use any powers that require movement. Users are able to reverse the effects.
