<p>The character is the resulot of a supernatural birth. They could be born by supernatural means like from, divinity, magic, science, etc. Those supernatural forces could produce various supernatural/uncommon effects upon the birth. This usually occurs when a non-supernatural or “normal” being (ex. humans) reproduces with a supernatural entity (ex. angels, cosmic entities, demons, dragons, gods, fairies, vampires, etc) with uncommon qualities or when two supernatural entities produce with each other. These can cause effects that determine their nature of being and not just specifically supernatural entities, but also clones or even “chosen ones”.
