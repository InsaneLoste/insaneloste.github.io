<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Draugr" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">draugr</a>, an undead creature from Norse mythology. They are undead Vikings that retain some semblance of intelligence and delight in the suffering that they cause. Physically they are usually relatively uncorrupted, if either very pale or "corpse-black" and larger and heavier than when they were alive: Thorolf of Eyrbyggja Saga was "uncorrupted, and with an ugly look about him... swollen to the size of an ox," and his body was so heavy that it could not be raised without levers. Draugar live in the graves of the dead, with a draugr being the animated body of the dead. As the graves of important men often contained a good amount of wealth, the draugr jealously guards his treasures even after death.
