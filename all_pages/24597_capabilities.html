There are abilities that have a unique significance, existing as representations of certain ideas, beliefs, materials or even idiosyncratic aspects like personality, existence, soul or philosophy. By engaging in esoteric practices, one can learn skills that allow for supernatural manifestations based on said representations. The simplest methods can take the form of unique attacks, defenses or transformations that resemble the symbolic essence.
