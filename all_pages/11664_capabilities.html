<p>The user can utilize the Heat Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around calokinetic power. Hot temperatures come about from increased amounts of kinetic energy. The particles in targets become more active, and the overall physical sensation that is detected is hot. Manipulating thermal power is a potent skill, and this style represents the higher end of the temperature spectrum. Controlling heat, or the increase of temperature, enables one access to specialized abilities. One can use heated temperatures to burn subjects like objects or beings, such as for attacks. As an extension, one can potentially create electricity, explosion, fire and plasma. Creatively, one could use it for unique techniques such as combustion, increasing particle activity to the point of causing explosions. With enough skill, one can expand their sphere of temperature influence to melt or incinerate entire areas, dehydrate environments or even cause widespread particle destabilization.
