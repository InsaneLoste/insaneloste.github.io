<p>The user can manipulate theirs and others' inertia as if it was divided into different parts. The divided parts in question would be inertia of rest (being still), inertia of motion (speed) and inertia of direction, rather than being combined as a whole. So the user could make it so that they are easy to accelerate at rest, harder to change their speed, and maybe easier to change direction than speed but harder to change then rest, for example. There can be more ways to use this power.
