<p>Users' sense of hearing is glaringly, obviously and super/unnaturally more acute than other beings in their universe because their capabilities are pushed to a superhuman level. Allowing them to hear anything over incredible distances, hear things that are seemingly too quiet to be discernible as well as being able to hear sounds over an insane range of frequencies. Advanced users are even able to hear individual molecules/atoms and their movements, or even the supernatural/paranormal, including the activities or spirits or immaterial beings and creatures. This also allows them to acquire auditory information from even the future or past.
