<li>Subjects with effectual eye lessees, or in another case, those that have <a href="/wiki/Eyeless_Perception" title="Eyeless Perception">Eyeless Perception</a> are immune. Due to the user of Hypnotic Eyes having to require their vision to control others, the eye roots that happen to transfer visual information into the brain to simulate eyesight are not there, meaning this will make the power useless.</li>
<li>Idiots may not be hypnotizable (one of the laws of hypnosis in the real world and most fantasy worlds).</li>
<li>Will not work if the victim is blind.</li>
<li>May require close eye contact.</li>
<li>Contact lenses or glasses may limit or cancel this power's intensity.</li>
<li>Direct eye contact may be needed, so breaking it will break the hypnosis.</li>
<li>In some cases, if the user's hypnotic eyes are reflected back at them (such as a mirror), it can hypnosis the user, if not immune to the effects.</li>
<li>May not work if their target is blindfolded or somehow manage to find a way to cover their eyes (e.g. use a bandage to wrap around their eyes to prevent eye contact).</li>
<li>Target may have to be physically present, meaning it may not work if the user tries to hypnotize someone on a talk screen.</li>
<li>May not work if either the user or victim has only one eye or has a lazy eye, or is near or far-sighted and is not wearing glasses.</li></ul>
