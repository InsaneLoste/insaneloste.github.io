<p>This indicates that an otherwise supernatural force is something inherent and natural to its setting, not something alien or other, but "relatively normal," likely running through the entirety (or at least the vast majority) of its setting. This inherent nature with either the setting, or a user if speaking of one to whom the force in question is something similarly ingrained and normal from their point of view, renders the force immune to things that normally negate, counter, ignore or otherwise negatively influence such "abnormalities/fantastical elements."
