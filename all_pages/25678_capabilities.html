<p>Users, either innately or through training, are masters of wielding swords of godlike power. These blades are of a truly transcendent quality and can strike down normally invulnerable entities, even those of godlike scale - while such weapons are immensely useful in dealing with extremely powerful opponents they often come with a catch, such as being severely unstable or causing lasting damage to the user - (this is normally done as a kind of plot-device, since access to such powerful weapons would otherwise make a character nigh-invincible due to the sheer destructive force at hand).
