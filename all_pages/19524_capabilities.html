<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate all possible existence all universes that are very different from our own. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Parallel_Existence_Manipulation" title="Parallel Existence Manipulation">Parallel Existence Manipulation</a>, which deals with alternate versions of things, the user affects different universes with different aspects that are not linked to our world but are completely different. The user can manipulate what is possible to exist in any multiverse/the omniverse, affecting how everything works, from concepts, physical laws work, what worlds there are, life there, the incomprehensible, what makes up matter and energy, how history and events work, how time and space work; all of that, in any multiverse or the omniverse can be manipulated.
