<p>The user can utilize the Technorganic Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around cyber-organic power. Both organic systems and technological devices can exhibit uniquely powerful effects. When combined, they can allow for greater power than either one could individually. Technorganic material allows for various types of creations and abilities based on the complexity and nature of the respective substances and the origins of the user. Some may be able to remotely manipulate preexisting cyber-organic matter or entities. Some may be born with technorganic natures. And then, there are those who have been transformed into cyborgs. Whatever the source, those who train to wield technorganic power can perform various feats including manipulating both organic and technological objects, crafting various constructs from bio-mechanical substances and channeling energies derived from said materials. It all depends on the user and their available features.
