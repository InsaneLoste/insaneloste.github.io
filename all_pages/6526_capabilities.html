<p>The user can create dimensions and nearly anything within the dimension (objects, creatures, etc.) and travel to them by creating a portal or just by wishing. They can bring other objects and organisms to their dimensions, although they must use more energy and concentration to do so. One might make a dimension where only they are invisible, and thus hide whenever being hunted by others.
