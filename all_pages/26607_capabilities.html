<p>User is or can transform into a vampiric dragon or an actual hybrid of vampire &amp; dragon. This gives them a boost in condition and attributes. Creatures like these are strong, may be huge, and has the flight power of a madman, but also can consume blood to make it stronger, can heal very quickly due to its healing factor, and is very quick on the ground and in the aerial zone. They possess a powerful bite that not only is capable of transforming other species but can also rip/tear their foe into shreds, killing them almost, if not instantly.
