<p>The user possesses their own, personalized summons. A person, creature, or object that is designed or chosen specifically for the user either as a physical or non-physical being. The user can manipulate their summons and control them from a distance. The summons will follow the user's every command and will protect the user even without a direct command. The summons can come in various shapes and sizes (like weapons, gadgets, vehicles, everyday items, humans, demons, spirits, angels, etc.). The summons strength may be driven by the user's force of will, physical movements, or by its own independent will.
