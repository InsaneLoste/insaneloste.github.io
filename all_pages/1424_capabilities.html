<p>The user can utilize the Anti-Force Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around anti-forces. Various forces exist in the universe; they act as the mechanisms behind the phenomena that make up reality. Conversely, whether in the same realm or originating from other worlds, there are anti-forces. These supernatural essences possess the same potency as the traditionally recognized forces, but they exhibit fundamentally opposing properties (e.g., anti-gravity creates repulsive effects as opposed to gravity’s attractive nature, anti-friction allows for smooth, slippery movement as opposed to friction’s resistant feature, anti-inertia allows for immovability or unstoppable movement as opposed to inertia’s forceful restrictions, etc.). For those who are trained to wield these essences, they can demonstrate specialized abilities beyond the scope of known forces. This can include enhancing one’s physical abilities or tools, creating attack and defense constructs or, at the highest levels, altering the nature of the world around them based on the anti-force wielded.
