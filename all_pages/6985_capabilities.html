<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a draconic abomination, an eldritch being with draconian heritage whose very existence defies the rules of nature and/or existence and is defined by its disregard for the natural laws of the universe as we understand them. They wield godlike powers and are, for the most part, not bound by the laws of the universe. Their true form cannot be grasped by mortal beings and may be interpreted differently. Combine with dragon powers and this being is much more powerful then any other.
