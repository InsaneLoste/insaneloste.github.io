<p>The character is a Day Deity, a god/goddess that is associated with the day and are mostly attributed to Light Deities or Sun Deities and are not as common in recorded history. However, this should not be confused with either of them as a Light Deity focuses on all forms of light (i.e. <a href="/wiki/Solar_Manipulation" title="Solar Manipulation">sunlight</a>, <a href="/wiki/Stellar_Manipulation" title="Stellar Manipulation">starlight</a>, etc.) while Solar Deities focus specifically on the sun, sunlight and its heat. Deities of the Day focus on light (specifically <a href="/wiki/Solar_Manipulation" title="Solar Manipulation">sunlight</a>) during the daytime.
