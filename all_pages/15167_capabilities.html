<p>The user can utilize the Mathematical Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around arithmetical power. Mathematics is the scientific discipline based on the relationships between numbers, equations, shapes and quantities. It provides a logical understanding of the world based on numerical measurements and observable designs. Variations can include algebra (formulas using symbols representing numbers for general operations), calculus (computations involving rates of change and predictions) and geometry (understanding observable figures such as dots, lines, angles, surfaces and solids). Normally, mathematics is used to empirically analyze and rationalize the world based on calculations. Under supernatural circumstances, it can potentially alter the nature of reality.
