<p>User possesses limitless flexibility, allowing them to contort/flex and move their bodies in any way imaginable/unimaginable. Being able to fit inside openings that are smaller or bigger than they are, rotate their bodies more then 360 degrees, stretch/move their limbs in erratic patterns, and/or even breaking their bones or snapping their neck does nothing to them, and more. This places the user above virtually all other beings in the universe in flexibility.
