<li>May be useless in areas with no gravity.</li>
<li>Users of <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Personal_Gravity" title="Personal Gravity">Personal Gravity</a> are either immune or highly resistant to the effects of gravity.</li>
<li>Distance, mass, precision, etc. Depend upon the knowledge, skill, and strength of the user and their power's natural limits.</li>
<li>The power may be centered around the user at all times, in which case the user can attract/repel relative to/from only their current location.</li>
