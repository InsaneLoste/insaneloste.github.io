<p>The user who is <a href="/wiki/Sealing" title="Sealing">sealed</a>/imprisoned can effect their prison and change it to their liking. Usually this power manifests in the ability to use ones powers despite the seals attempts to block them, corrupting guardians into henchmen, changing the prison and the landscape around it so it kills anyone trying to keep you in and even allows you to temporarily leave your prison.
