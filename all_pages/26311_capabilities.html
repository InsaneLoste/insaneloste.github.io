<p>The user has the ability to have great movements and actions when using or wearing non fitting objects, like loose, long clothes or armor that barely fits or moves around on the user or their body parts. It can also be used to interact with unfitting objects and use them well, like making a human gyroscope or a swinging bar, both made out of clothes, look rigid and easy to use. Imagine you are in a piece of armor or clothing much larger than yourself, and it is supposed to move around while you are inside of it as you move, which would create problems because it could interfere with your movement. With Loose Movement, that problem does not happen, and the user does not have such issues.
