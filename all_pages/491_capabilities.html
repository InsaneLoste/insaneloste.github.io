<p>Users possess a special type of adaptive magic, allowing them to spontaneously create new spells if they have enough understanding of the desired effects, and adapt magical effects on the fly to meet the needs of every situation. They can intuitively learn any kind of magic, absorb any kind of energy to power-up their magic, scan objects/beings/phenomena to incorporate their effects to their magical options, and recombine known magical effects into brand new ones.
