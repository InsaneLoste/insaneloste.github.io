<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mirror" title="wikipedia:Mirror">mirrors</a>, objects that reflect light in a way that preserves much of its original quality subsequent to its contact with the mirror. Most mirrors are designed for visible light; however, mirrors designed for other types of waves or other wavelengths of electromagnetic radiation are also used, especially in non-optical instruments.
