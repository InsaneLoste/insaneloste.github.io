<p>The user can create cracks by taking two parts of time and space and pressing them together, causing a split in the very fabrics of reality. Some cracks can act as wormholes between two different places in time, others release time energy that has the ability to erase objects from time itself as well as events. Time travelers would be able to remember erased events or objects if they are not directly involved with their past. When the time energy erases a person or event, the consequences would still remain (i.e. erasing a war with the present day remain the same war-affected world).
