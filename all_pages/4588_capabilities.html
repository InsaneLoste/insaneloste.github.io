<p>The user can utilize the Cold Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around frigiokinetic power. Cold temperatures come about from decreased amounts of kinetic energy. The particles in targets become less active, and the overall physical sensation that is detected is cool. Manipulating thermal power is a potent skill, and this style represents the lower end of the temperature spectrum. Controlling cold, or the decrease or total absence of heat, enables one access to specialized abilities. One can use chilled temperatures to freeze subjects like objects or beings, such as for attacks. As an extension, one can potentially create ice and snow. Creatively, one could use it for unique techniques such as cryostasis, placing targets in a state of suspended animation. With enough skill, one can expand their sphere of temperature influence to rob entire areas of heat, causing widespread frozen conditions or potentially bringing existence to a standstill.
