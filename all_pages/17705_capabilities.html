<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Orgone" title="wikipedia:Orgone">orgone radiation</a>, a theoretical anti-entropic radiology perceived as a creative substratum in all of nature comparable to Mesmer's animal magnetism. Orgone rays are often attributed as massless, omnipresent substance, similar to luminiferous aether, yet better associated with <a href="/wiki/Life-Force_Manipulation" title="Life-Force Manipulation">living energy</a> over inert matter. Allegedly Orgone Radiation coalesces to create organization on all scales, from the smallest microscopic to macroscopic in orgone theory.
