<p>The user can defy purpose, usually their own, meaning they can effectively be free from it and not be limited to one purpose at all, and they can do things they otherwise can't. They can do this physically, mentally, spiritually or existentially. They can change their bodies, minds, souls or overall existence so that each or all of them is suited for a different purpose, thus defying the purpose they were originally meant for.
