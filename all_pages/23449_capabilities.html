<p>The user can ignore and defy speed limits in doing things, specifically orbital velocity, terminal velocity and escape velocity, or the velocity something needs to stay in orbit, the velocity something reaches after accelerating when moving or falling or the velocity something needs to escape the gravity of a planet respectively. They are not bound by these velocities, and can ignore them whenever. This also applies to velocities needed to counteract forces while doing something, such as running up a wall.
