<p>The user can fully <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Empathy" title="wikipedia:Empathy">interpret</a> the emotions, moods, and temperaments of others without reading apparent symptoms, allowing them to understand introverts or discover one emotion is actually hiding another. They can attack someone in a personal and emotional way since they know exactly what emotion is flowing through themselves and can use this knowledge to play against them. Some users may learn to read emotional imprints left into environment or objects.
Usually over time, an Empath's power grows to the point that they can <a href="/wiki/Emotion_Manipulation" title="Emotion Manipulation">manipulate emotions</a> in others, and possibly use them to <a href="/wiki/Emotion_Empowerment" title="Emotion Empowerment">empower themselves</a>. The user may learn to extend their power over/on vast numbers of sentient beings or reach extreme distances, even other levels of existence but this may be possible only if the user has an emotional link to those the search is already in effect on.
