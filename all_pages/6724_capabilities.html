<p>The user can cause targets (whether organic or inorganic material) to lose cohesion by various means. Some can make matter fall apart into dust, wipe away their target on a molecular/sub-atomic level or even revert matter into pure energy. Regardless of the means, the target is reduced to either molecular/sub-atomic dust or energy but not absolutely annihilated.
