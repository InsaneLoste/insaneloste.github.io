<p>The user is able to control quantum physics to simulate the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics on a macroscopic scale generating a probabilistic duality of life and death, ie. a status of having equal probability of being dead and alive at the same time. This ability can either be used to place other objects and beings within this dualistic state or the user can assume the <a href="/wiki/Stochastic_Mimicry" title="Stochastic Mimicry">physiology</a> of this quantum uncertainty leading to unpredictable effects.
