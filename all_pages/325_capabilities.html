<p>User's bodily systems grow to be stronger, tougher, faster and better at a much faster rate as the body grows. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Accelerated_Body" title="Accelerated Body">Accelerated Body</a>, which is just limited to bodily speed, the user's body systems, all of them, grow over time as the user ages/matures, making them better than those of other people. Their nervous system, skeletal system, digestive system, immune system, muscular system, etc. all grow better and faster as time goes by.
