<p>The user can make movements that are involuntary and automatic in every way. The user could not only make simple movements without needing to think, but they can do tasks and use skills (even the hardest ones) involuntarily with ease. Because they don't have to use their brain to make such movements, the user can freely think on their own while making good judgement. The user can perform movements no matter how complex. This can also be used for multitasking.
