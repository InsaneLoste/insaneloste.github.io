<p>The character is an interdimensional entity by occupying two or more dimensions, essentially having an interdimensional <a href="/wiki/Multipresence" title="Multipresence">Multipresence</a>. While they exist within those boundaries, they can only affect one dimension at a time and usually appear transparent in either one or the other. They cannot be detected by conventional instruments due to not being "entirely real" as their existence is split between other dimensions.
