<p>The user's hand is imbued with the power of a god, and is thus granted incredible power by that god. For instance, if one were to have the power of Kratos, the Greek God of Strength, one might have <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Absolute_Strength" title="Absolute Strength">unlimited strength</a> through that particular hand. Or, if the user represented the Christian God, they might be <a href="/wiki/Omnipotence" title="Omnipotence">Omnipotent</a>. Regardless, their power would be channeled through that arm or hand. The power granted depends on the deity which the user represents. In <i>God Hand</i>, it is said that the user of the God Hand possesses the power to "become a god or a demon", a metaphor for the choice between good and evil.
