<p>The user is capable of activating their own internalized magical power. This way the user won't worry about drawing magic from outside sources or restrain from rules that would normally hinder their use of magic for a certain amount of time. Users with this power are capable of manifesting their magic internally, often with the effects applied solely to the user. And because the magic is an extension of the user, they can utilize their magic in any way they wish. This can lead to unique magical powers, self-magic augmentation, mana/magical energy control, etc.
