<p>The user can reversibly stack multiple points of a timeline of one place (or a small region) in one moment. This has the effect of making the past present and future of the region in space to occur all at once (usually means suddenly crowded with objects). This allows the user to change history at multiple points in the timeline without actually time traveling there to do so.
