<p>The user is made up of or can transform their body completely into saliva, an extracellular fluid made up of 99.5% <a href="/wiki/Water_Mimicry" title="Water Mimicry">water</a>, and 1% enzymes, white blood cells, <a href="/wiki/Mucus_Mimicry" title="Mucus Mimicry">mucus</a>, epithelial cells, several antimicrobial agents, and other compounds and substances of previously digested edibles. A user's transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of saliva, in which case it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other. Being made of saliva means they can likely make others repelled by them, or use their body as a form of lubricant. Depending on the type of saliva they're made of, they may even have nerve growth factor protein, however this is mostly reserved in animals like rats.
