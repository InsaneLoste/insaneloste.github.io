<p>Users can perceive the information of any situation and use the variables of that information to predict/perceive the paths that lead to certain outcomes, based on what choices are made. They can then accelerate themselves along the path of their desire, which causes them to reach the conclusion of the path taken. Users can use this ability to accurately predict/perceive not just one future, but also calculate probabilities to infer different multiple futures likely to occur.
