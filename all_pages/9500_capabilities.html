<p>User can create, shape and manipulate the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nuclear_fallout" title="wikipedia:Nuclear fallout">nuclear fallout</a>, the residual radioactive material propelled into the upper atmosphere following a nuclear blast or a nuclear reaction conducted in an unshielded facility, so called because it "falls out" of the sky after the explosion and shock wave have passed. It commonly refers to the radioactive dust and ash created when a nuclear weapon explodes, but such dust can also originate from a damaged nuclear plant. Fallout may take the form of black rain (rain darkened by particulates).
