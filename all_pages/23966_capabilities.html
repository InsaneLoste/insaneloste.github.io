<p>Users can project the effect of their physical strikes (punch, kick, headbutt, etc.) as if they were a projectile. The projection also applies to their strikes' specific properties, possibly enhanced further by the user's own abilities: infusions (fire, electricity, ice, light, darkness, etc.), effects on touch (death, disintegration, petrification, absorption, corruption), and various others.
