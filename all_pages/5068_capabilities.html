<p>The user can affect the continuity, or the unbroken and consistent existence or operation of something over a period of time, of anything. This includes matter, patterns, events, time, space, energy, sequences, etc. An example of use for this power would be making events not flow well or be inconsistent, like making events not connect or lead to each other and be entirely different in terms of order.
