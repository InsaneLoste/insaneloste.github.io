<p>The user can manipulate their own internal and external chemical energies. It is the potential energy that is responsible for binding atoms and molecules together in structures. This is also found within the user as well. They are able to channel the reactive energies needed to convert chemical energy in order to use it. This allows them to control chemical reactions, chemistry, elemental make-up, and much more.
