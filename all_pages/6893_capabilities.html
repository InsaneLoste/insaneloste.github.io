<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a Djinni (also spelled: Djin, Djinn, Djinny and Djinnee), Air type Jinn in Arabian Mythology, their bodies sharp like copper capable of mimicking the air. Djinni are capable of manipulating the air to whatever they see fit and due to the nature bound to the air they are grand experts in air types of abilities because it's a part of them.
