<p>The user can operate and function without gravity. Without gravity, it is virtually impossible to stay on the surface of a planet, asteroid, moon or any particular body without falling off of it after being launched into the air, due to inertia causing things to fly off into space if there was no gravity. A lack of gravity could also make it hard to walk on the surface. The user does not have this problem, as they can move normally as if there were gravity acting on them on any surface.
