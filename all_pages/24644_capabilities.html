<p>The user can ignore the properties of tachyons, which go faster when they have less energy, meaning that with zero energy, they have infinite speed, and that they take infinite energy to slow down to the speed of light. The user does not need to go by these laws and properties, and can go at even infinite speed while keeping their energy, or slow down to the speed of light with finite energy.
