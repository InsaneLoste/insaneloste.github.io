<p>User can manipulate the abstracts (or concept) of energy. This can have many feats, such as being able to completely transform matter into energy without any being lost as heat, having the power to create energy out of nothing or destroy it (in complete violation of the law of conservation of energy) or conduct energy transfers that do not increase universal entropy.
