<p>The user is immune to physical pain of any kind, being unable to feel any sorts of physical pain, allowing them to think clearly and continue to move without even flinching despite a grievous injury. The user can think clearly, continue to move, ignore torture and generally function in situations where the pain would disable a normal person.  The user does not react at all when damaged, they can walk onward as they are being damaged or continue fighting without stopping so long as they can move.
