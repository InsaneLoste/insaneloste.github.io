<p>The user can ignore Newton's Third Law of Motion, which states that "every action force exerted must come with an equal and opposite reaction force". The action force, reaction force or both can be defied. They can apply a force on themselves without pushing back, exert forces on things without knocking them over, push against things without being pushed back or otherwise walk on air and water, even with unequal accelerations and masses between the air or water and the body and more strength/force than the reaction force exerts back onto the user. They can also go in different directions or exert different magnitudes different from what the action-reaction force originally intended the user to have.
