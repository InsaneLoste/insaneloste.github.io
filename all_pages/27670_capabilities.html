<p>The user can see x-rays, electromagnetic waves of high energy and very short wavelength, which are able to pass through many materials opaque to light. This can be used for medical purposes such as the detection of cancers, tumour, blackened lungs, etc. The skill of perceiving a specific location (i.e. artery) is given by partial reflection of the ray from each specific surface surveyed.
