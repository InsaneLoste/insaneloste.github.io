<p>The user exists beyond the concept of time, which makes them absolutely immune to its effects and all that is caused by it time and temporal phenomena/powers. They are <a href="/wiki/Unfettered_Body" title="Unfettered Body">ageless and untouchable</a> to anything that happens in time. As their body exists beyond time, they do not expend any energy, and neither need to eat nor sleep or get fatigued, any diseases do not progress, thus rendering them immune to diseases. They may also exhibit regenerative capabilities as a result of their temporal transcendence, as their bodies will always revert to the point in time in which they were not injured.
