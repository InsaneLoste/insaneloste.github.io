<p>The user can create unique fictional or self-created fictional characters and then morph oneself into said characters as if they are an extension of the user themselves. The users must come up with a rough idea of the characters appearance and what it can do and the power filling in the blanks from there. These forms can vary greatly from humanoid (with various weaponry and skills) to animals, mythical beings or even objects. On top of that, each character is well equipped with their own unique physiology, capabilities and equipment. Advanced users can take it even further by customizing/modifying their forms for more versatility, alter/remake physical features, reshape and reconstruct them, customize their various properties and upgrade them and their capabilities.
