<p>The user is a kayeri. They are a Colombian and Venezuelan folklore creature that appears during rainy seasons. Every mushroom and certain plants and vines in the forest are kayeri. They have a yellow or blue-green hat. The Kayeri are strong and fast. Their diet is exclusively on cows. They will pick up cows and run away with them. The most effective method of killing a Kayeri is to shoot them in the kidney with a bone-tipped arrow.
