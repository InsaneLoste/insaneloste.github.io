<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sodium" title="wikipedia:Sodium">Sodium</a>, a soft, silver-white, good conductor of electricity, highly reactive member of the alkali metals. These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 Mbar, the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent, with a red color; and at 3 Mbar sodium is a clear and transparent solid.
