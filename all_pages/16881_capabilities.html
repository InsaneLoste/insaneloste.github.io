<p>Users of this ability can either mimic the traits of a Nigawarai or are one, Nigawarai are demonic yokai created by humans who have become overwhelmed by hatred and spite, as yokai they become ugly monsters with horns and green, hairy bodies. They wear dirty rags and their mouths are forever twisted into forced smiles. They feed on hatred and spite, as well as feed on such properties, causing humans to bicker and develop ill-will towards each other - they also have poisonous claws that can easily paralyze anything they scratch.
