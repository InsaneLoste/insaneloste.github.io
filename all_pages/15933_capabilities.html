<p>The user can ignore momentum, impulse and the law of conservation of momentum. Momentum is mass in motion, or mass times velocity, and impulse is the change in momentum, or force times time. The law of conservation of momentum states that the total momentum of two objects remains the same as long as no external forces are applying to them.
