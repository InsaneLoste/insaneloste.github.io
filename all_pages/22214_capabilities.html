<p>Users can move easily even when the process of their movement is very sequential. For example, if the user's body parts are made of smaller parts that act one by one before the user actually moves, or if the process of thinking to produce movement is otherwise not one step, the user can still move normally without delay. This also works on neurological, mental processes as well.
