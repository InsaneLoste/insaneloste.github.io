<p>The user can speed through the progress of advancing civilization due to various powers or technology. The civilization's culture, society, technology, sciences, economy, transport, communications, tools, and weapons will evolve faster than what is considered naturally possible. In some instances, the progression experienced by the civilization can be self-induced or self-affecting, such as a result of environmental factors. This allows for the area, its inhabitants and their respective cultural aspects (biology, technology, etc.) to evolve as well.
