<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hidebehind" title="wikipedia:Hidebehind">Hidebehind</a>, a nocturnal fearsome critter from American folklore that preys upon humans that wander the woods, and was credited for the disappearances of early colonial loggers when they failed to return to camp. Early accounts describe hidebehinds as large, powerful animals, despite the fact that no one was able to see them.
