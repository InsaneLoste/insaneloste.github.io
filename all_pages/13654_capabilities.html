<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kobold" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Kobold</a>, a sprite stemming from Germanic mythology and surviving into modern times in German folklore. Although usually invisible, a kobold can materialize in the form of an animal (wet cats and hens, bats, cats, roosters, snakes, worms, etc), fire, a human being, and a candle. The most common depictions of kobolds show them as humanlike figures the size of small children. Kobolds who live in human homes wear the clothing of peasants; those who live in mines are hunched and ugly; and kobolds who live on ships smoke pipes and wear sailor clothing.
