<p>The user is able to create living beings through the manipulation of elemental forces (fire, water, earth, etc.). Whether they form the basis of their physiology or are the animating force, elements are used create newfound animated existence. They can come with sentience and even souls when created. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Elemental_Entity_Creation" title="Elemental Entity Creation">Elemental Entity Creation</a>, this power allows for actual life to come into being, not simply elemental-based forms. The animating force aspect also makes it so the entities do not need to be made of elements; they can simply be powered by them.
