<p>User can enhance, augment, increase and multiply the immunity/immune system of oneself and/or others, granting them increased resistance, if not outright immunity, to such things as disease and poisons. This immunity may even extend to powers and other concepts. However, the user cannot create or produce immunity, they simply are just able amplify the immunity that's already there.
