<p>The user can propel themselves from any or all sides of the body without (sometimes) using their feet. They can propel themselves using muscles, jets, helicopter-like propulsion or any other kind there is. They can use this to propel themselves from two or more sides at once, such as downward by using top-side propulsion and backwards using the the front side propulsion. Should the user be able to use attraction or repulsion at the same time, the user can use this to increase their speed. Also, they can use propulsion from two opposing sides such as front and back to slow down or stop themselves or stay in one place or levitate.
