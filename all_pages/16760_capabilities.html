<p>The user either is or can transform into <a class="external text" href="http://www.monstropedia.org/index.php?title=Nelapsi" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Nelapši</a>, a walking corpse with pale skin, red eyes, black hair, claws, and pointy teeth. They're extremely powerful and feral, with an insatiable appetite, and won't stop hunting until dawn when they're forced to return to their graves. They drink the blood of both humans and animals, and before doing so, they kill their prey by either tearing into the victim with their bite or by crushing them. Being a patient and devious predator, sometimes they torture their victims for weeks before killing and feeding on them. A single Nelapši can massacre whole villages in <i>one</i> night, survivors (if any) are killed by the plague the Nelapši inevitably brings.
