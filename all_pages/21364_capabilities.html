<p>Users know everything about past/history/former events. As such, they know everything about the creation of the universe, the possible creators, and all possible paths that stemmed from it. As time goes on, they become more and more knowledgeable. Even a second passing would grant them an infinite amount of knowledge of everything that happened during the time frame.
