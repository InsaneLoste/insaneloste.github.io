<p>The user, either innately or through training, is a master of <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wing_Chun" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">Wing Chun</a>, a southern Chinese martial art uses solid stances, rapid focused strikes and swift parrying. Wing Chun favors a relatively high, narrow stance with the elbows close to the body. Within the stance, arms are generally positioned across the vital points of the center line with hands in a vertical "wu sau" ("protecting hand" position). This puts the practitioner in a position to make readily placed blocks and fast-moving blows to vital striking points down the center of the body, i.e. the neck, chest, belly and groin. Shifting or turning within a stance is done on the heels, balls, or middle (K1 or Kidney point 1) of the foot, depending on the lineage. Some Wing Chun styles discourage the use of high kicks because this risks counter-attacks to the groin. The practice of "settling" one's opponent to brace them more effectively against the ground helps one deliver as much force as possible.
