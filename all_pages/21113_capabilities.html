<p>Users of this ability either are or can gain the traits of a Red Lady, a world-wide type of ghost that manifests as a woman dressed in red, often they are the result of women who have been victims of lust or objectification, causing them to haunt the living - they differ from their White Lady counterparts in the fact they are usually neutral or even benevolent spirits who while frightening to mortals are largely harmless and do not seek vengeance or misery to the living, like many ghosts they are often considered to be trapped between worlds, waiting for a means to complete an unfinished task (such as revealing their murderer, uncovering their body or bringing others to lost treasure).
