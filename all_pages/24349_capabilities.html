<p>Users possess an immense level of power that is beyond measure. Moreover, the user has a deep reservoir of it at disposal. Their ability can take the form of any force, be it elemental, energy, magic, life-force or psionics, etc. In any case, the power level the user has outclasses most. They can apply that level of power to strengthen their abilities, allowing them to literally shake the foundations of their world and possibly beyond.
