<p>The user can see the <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/String_(physics)" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">strings</a> that form reality floating around everywhere and change anything they wish by grabbing whatever the string is connected to and tugging it to how the user wants it to be. They can rearrange reality in ways they deem fit and alter them according to the strings that make up their existence.
