<p>The users of this power are <a href="/wiki/Angel_Physiology" title="Angel Physiology">angels</a>, and not all angels are "beautiful" by human standards; as some look outright terrifying and not remotely human in anyway. These types of angels which are considered "abominations" take on bizarre monstrous forms, sinister geometric shapes, or even being so alien in appearance that no man can understand or withstand them physically or mentally; like flaming wheels, multiple/even dozens of eyes, arms or no arms, multiple faces, heads and wings all over their bodies, appearing as eldritch-type beings without being actual eldritch entities. Even appearing to be physically made of stone or metal, being made of holy fire and/or light, lacking certain crucial parts of a "normal" human and even animal anatomies, having the heads of eagles, lions and bulls, being entirely different from what mortal humans are use to.
