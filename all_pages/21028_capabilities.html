<p>User is able to apply metaphysical filters to the world to redefine reality similar to that of a green screen making the user see reality as a big green screen and the user can apply certain metaphysical "pictures to reality." When used, the filters that are placed on to reality will change the world's <i>original/previous</i> state and everything before turning it into whatever the user pictures for example, The user can overwrite the currently reality and make into whatever they want it to be. The user can change the whole world into their own palace or whatever they picture it to be even the inhabitants can change. By extension, the user is able to perform actions, simple or intuitive, risky or safe, regardless of any actual danger or consequence to what is considered, the "<i>Pure World</i>".
