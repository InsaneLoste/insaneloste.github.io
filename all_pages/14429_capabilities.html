<p>Users can manipulate <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Logic" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">logic</a>, the reasoning conducted or assessed according to strict principles of validity or situations, actions, circumstances or qualities of being justifiable by reason. With this power, users can achieve logically impossible feats on a whim, and freely redefine on a metaphysical level what is possible and impossible. This ability may be either derived from some highly transcendent powers, or simply exist without much of a cause. Despite being completely outclassed by forces beyond logic, the user can legitimately be considered among the most powerful beings in existence, shaping <a href="/wiki/Reality_Warping" title="Reality Warping">reality</a>, <a href="/wiki/Metaphysics_Manipulation" title="Metaphysics Manipulation">metaphysics</a> and <a href="/wiki/Causality_Manipulation" title="Causality Manipulation">causation</a> with nothing but a thought and ignoring all kinds of physical and metaphysical laws like they didn't exist at all. Essentially, to anything bound by logic, the user would seem completely <a href="/wiki/Selective_Invincibility" title="Selective Invincibility">undefeatable</a> and capable of doing anything, perhaps even appearing to be Omnipotent.
