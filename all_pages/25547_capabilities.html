<p>Users are knowledgeable on torture without limit, allowing them to inflict unspeakable and often eternal (or at least extremely long) torment upon any individual or concept; even beings such as angels, demons, gods, spirits or conceptual abstract entities can be affected. It would require a nigh-omnipotent entity or intervention from such entity to counter these absolute tortures, and even that may not entirely prevent ever-lasting scars (this is made even more prominent in that often it is nigh-omnipotent characters who are capable of inflicting such torture in the first place).
