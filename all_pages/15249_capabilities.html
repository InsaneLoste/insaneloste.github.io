Since every moving object has mechanical energy, whether it is a hammer driving a nail, a leaf falling from a tree, or a rocket flying in space, it is very hard to master. Most users manipulate the energy from machines that use mechanical energy to do work. Our bodies also use mechanical energy to perform motions such as throwing a ball or moving a pencil to write on paper.
