<p>A user with this trait can take on the abilities of a Sack Man or is one. A Sack Man is envisioned as a type of child-hunting monster in Spanish, Portuguese, and Latin American folklore, that manifests as an impossibly ugly and skinny old man carrying a large sack who wanders the land searching for "naughty" children - whom he is said to capture and stuff in his bag before spiriting them away to a grisly fate (many tales say that the "Sack Man" eats his young victims).
