<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marid" title="wikipedia:Marid">Marid</a>, a type of jinn associated with open waters of the seas and oceans where it finds sanctuary. Marids are often considered as the most powerful type of jinn, having especially great water-based powers. Like every jinn, they have free will yet can be compelled to perform chores. According to folklore, they also have the ability to grant wishes to mortals, but that usually requires battle, imprisonment, rituals, or just a great deal of flattery.
