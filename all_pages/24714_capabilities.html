<p>Users, either innately or through training, are masters of operating tanks, armored fighting vehicles intended as primary offensive weapons in front-line ground combat. Tank designs are a balance of heavy firepower, strong armor, and good battlefield mobility provided by tracks and a powerful engine; usually their main armament is mounted in a turret. Users may be masters of each specific type of tank.
