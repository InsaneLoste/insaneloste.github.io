<p>The user can manipulate their own personal monster, invoking a uniquely powerful, often large, destructive and aggressive creature that can perform various tasks according to the user’s will. Monsters come in a variety of shapes, sizes and temperaments; thus, they can manifest various powers depending on their nature. The relationship can be the result of being born of the user’s own body, a supernatural summons or having a contract created, whether willfully (<a href="/wiki/Contract_Bestowal" title="Contract Bestowal">Contract Bestowal</a>) or through manipulation (<a href="/wiki/Submission" title="Submission">Submission</a>). Whatever the circumstances, the monster will enable the user capabilities that can range from acting as a personal attack beast to potentially combining with the user to enhance their own power (<a href="/wiki/Monster_Symbiosis" title="Monster Symbiosis">Monster Symbiosis</a>).
