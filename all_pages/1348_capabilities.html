<p>The user can transform their and/or other's shadows into living beings. As the rule of anything happening to the real body happens to the shadow, this ability may allow the user to warp the shadow to manipulate the form of themselves or others, causing anything that happens to the shadow to be reflected in the true body; in short, a form of "reverse shadow puppetry."
