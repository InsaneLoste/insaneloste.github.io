<p>The user can utilize the Symbiotic Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around symbiotic power. Whether one is born bonded or seeks out a partner, symbiosis requires three main aspects: entity, host and the ability to link with each other. Through this connection, the host can manifest supernatural capabilities; however, training can take this particular relationship to even greater heights of power. By engaging in practices based around the enhancement of the connection, one can learn to bring about newfound abilities such as the manipulation of symbiotic matter/energy, enhanced regeneration and unique attacks. Ultimately, this is all dependent on the nature/strength of the bond with the entity.
