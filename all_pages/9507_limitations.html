<ul><li>Users of powers that deal with mind, souls, dreams/nightmares, or hallucination/illusion are highly resistant, immune or able to leave their prison and release others as well.</li>
<li>Since this power only involves the senses, it is unlike the user can kill targets within the fake world.</li>
<li>Conversely, targets could die or be injured in reality if they are in the illusion as their mind could make it real.</li>
<li>May be only able to trap 1 target at a time.</li>
<li>May be only to trap targets for a short amount of time.</li>
<li>May be only to trap certain species, e.g., humans.</li>
<li>Outside stimuli like pain, loud noises, and strong smells might snap targets out of it.</li>
<li>If the world is not convincing enough to be reality, it could motivate targets to wake up.</li>
<li>My only work on others and not the user.</li></ul>
