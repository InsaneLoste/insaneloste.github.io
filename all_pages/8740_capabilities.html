<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate elemental forces derived from various entities (animals/beasts, spirits, deities, demons, <a href="/wiki/Inner_Being" title="Inner Being">Inner Beings</a>, <a href="/wiki/Materialized_Guardian" title="Materialized Guardian">Materialized Guardians</a>, etc.). The entities possess natural powers (such as air, fire, water, earth, etc.) that the user can access and control according to their will. Because of their unique nature, the elements being manipulated may have special aspects and effects not normally found elsewhere, either in the natural world or among other elemental power users.
