<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a transcendent lich: an undead mage of god-like power. A transcendent lich is associated with death, the dead, spirits, dark magics, and necromancy, as well as being above all other liches. These types of liches were either undead deities or liches who have ascended so high after death that this was the natural outcome of their dark power, or these liches started out as regular liches that use to be human and ascended as high as they could through their craft, becoming transcendent beings.
