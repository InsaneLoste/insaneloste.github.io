<p>The user is able to warp reality by speaking metaphors. If they say "it's raining cats and dogs!" cause the sky to literally pour forth a myriad of stray dogs and cats which would fall to the ground, get up and run rampant in the streets (along with literal rain, of course). Or they may say “Break a leg!” to a friend just before a stage performance, and the laws of reality will bend to cause that friend to do just that, and the like.
