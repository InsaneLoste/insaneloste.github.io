<p>The user can manipulate the three <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rotation_around_a_fixed_axis" title="wikipedia:Rotation around a fixed axis">axis of rotation</a>, the imaginary line a body rotates along, and can be external (like a planet around the sun) and internal (like a ball spinning), usually among the object or person's center of gravity. The user can re-position where the axes of rotation intersect and are located in or out of the physical body to change how they rotate. For example, if the axes of rotation are relocated to the end of the stick part of a broomstick, the broom will rotate at the end of the stick rather than the center. If the axes of rotation are moved outside the broom, the broom, in whatever position it is in, will swing around in a circle around an imaginary object.
