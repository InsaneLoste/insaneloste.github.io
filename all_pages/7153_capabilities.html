<p>User is made up of or can transform their body into various beverages/drinks (such as coffee, tea, soda, wine, juice, <a href="/wiki/Milk_Mimicry" title="Milk Mimicry">milk</a>, etc). Users' transformed forms can be anatomically identical to their normal forms, aside from being made of drinks, in which case they contain all organs and are somewhat vulnerable to attacks, or users can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
