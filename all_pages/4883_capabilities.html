<p>The user can manipulate the abstracts (or concept) of elementary particles and/or particles of a conceptual nature. Not only can they control the nature of the interactions they undergo (how they form matter and energy), they can also alter the way abstract units affect the very nature (i.e., conceptual aspects) of existence. As reality can be seen as being made up of particles in one form or another, possessing control of this ability can potentially grant one godlike abilities that can range from the localized to the universal to the multiversal.
