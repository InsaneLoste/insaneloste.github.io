<p>User is able to transform their body completely into water in all its states: <a href="/wiki/Water_Mimicry" title="Water Mimicry">liquid</a>, <a href="/wiki/Ice_Mimicry" title="Ice Mimicry">solid</a>, and <a href="/wiki/Cloud_Mimicry" title="Cloud Mimicry">gas</a>. Users' transformed forms can be anatomically identical to their normal forms, aside from being made of water, in which case they contain all organs and are somewhat vulnerable to attacks, or users can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
