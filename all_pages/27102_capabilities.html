<p>User is immune to all water, being completely invulnerable to direct and indirect effects. Since force is the main strength of water, the user can essentially withstand tidal wave-levels of aquatic power. This means they cannot be knocked, smashed nor drowned by crashing waves or tsunamis. Water also softens hard surfaces, so the user can sustain their grip where others would easily slide off.
