<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a Noble Elf, a subrace of elves that are born from Modern and <a href="/wiki/Transcendent_Elf_Physiology" title="Transcendent Elf Physiology">Transcendent Elf</a>/Mythic Elf. In the Elven community, these types of elves would be considered Demigods. This is because they are born as the offspring of a Modern Elf, a near mortal form of elves, and a Mythic Elf, an elven being with power that is considered transcendent. This stated, members of this subrace will be more powerful than most of the elven subraces, even the High Elves.
