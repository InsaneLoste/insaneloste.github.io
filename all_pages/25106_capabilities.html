<p>The user can isolate and completely erase time and/orÂ certain periods in time whether from the past or future. They are able to eliminate moments in time and completely destroy the time that moment occurred within; making all records and memory (in exception of the user) completely altered as if that event never happened and all things that would or should happen will replace the deleted event. Upon deletion, Small-scaled erasure will effect a specific few people while large-scaled erasure will effect the masses or even the entire universe drastically.
