<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ningyo" title="wikipedia:Ningyo">ningyo</a> (literally: Fish Human), described with a monkey’s mouth with small teeth like a fish’s, shining golden scales, and a quiet voice like a skylark or a flute. Traditionally they resemble more closely fish than humans, with a varying level of human-like features, ranging from just an ugly, deformed fish-like face to an entire human torso with long, bony fingers and sharp claws. They are hideous to behold, resembling more of an otherworldly nightmare than a seductive siren and can range in size from the size of a human child to the size of a large seal. However, modern ningyo tend to be more human-like and/or attractive.
