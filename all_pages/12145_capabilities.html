<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulics" title="wikipedia:Hydraulics">hydraulics</a>, the science involving the application of liquid pressure to enable mechanical processes. When liquid is put through intense pressure, it can generate kinetic energy. The higher the pressure, the greater the amount of energy that is produced. Through specialized processes, one can harness that kind of energy to perform various forms of work. While it can be utilized in sciences like engineering and chemistry, it is often found in different types of technology. <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hydraulic_machinery" title="wikipedia:Hydraulic machinery">Hydraulic machinery</a> can include vehicular components (like brakes) , loading equipment (like cranes) and even the human body; the cardiovascular system uses pressurized blood to transport oxygen through the body.
