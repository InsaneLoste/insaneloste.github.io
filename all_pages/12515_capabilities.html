<p>User can create any technomagical devices just by imagining them. The created devices are permanent and their existence irreversible. They are all under the users' complete control, and may be remolded or merged the same way they were created to fit a different purpose. In order to create them, users must come up with a rough idea of the appearance, function and effects, the power filling in the blanks from there.
