<p>The user can bend the space of the target, whether being, object or anything else, in order to reshape them by stretching, twisting, deforming and bending them in any way possible without harming them, tearing them apart or breaking them (even if they are inelastic). Manipulating an object's space, one could do things such as tie an elephant into a knot without harming its body or folding a computer without damaging it. The contortions are rather inelastic, and whatever is warped will remain that way until the user decides otherwise.
