<p>The user can manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electromagetism" title="wikipedia:electromagetism">electromagnetism</a>: one of the four fundamental forces in the physical universe responsible for numerous phenomenon cases, notably those affiliated with electricity and magnetism. Electromagnetism is responsible for <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electromagnetic_field" title="wikipedia:electromagnetic field">electromagnetic fields</a> (an area of space comprised of electric and magnetic fields), the propagation of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electromagnetic_radiation" title="wikipedia:electromagnetic radiation">electromagnetic radiation</a> or the <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/electromagnetic_spectrum" title="wikipedia:electromagnetic spectrum">electromagnetic spectrum</a>, such as visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, microwaves, and radio waves. Exploration of electromagnetism necessitates understanding various branches of physical science, such as classical mechanics, quantum mechanics, and special relativity. Electromagnetism demonstrates impressive characteristics and exploitation with human inventions using electromagnetism to power intelligent devices, vehicles, power-generating stations, buildings, and more. Due to the user manipulating electromagnetism, they hold the untapped potential to perform and execute efficaciously powerful techniques.
