<p>The user can use <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Subliminal_stimuli" title="wikipedia:Subliminal stimuli">subliminal messages</a>: any sensory stimuli below an individual's threshold for conscious perception. Commonly, the conscious mind cannot register and receive these stimuli except the subconscious or unconscious mind. These can generate anything (audio, videos, images, etc.) to bypass the conscious threshold to direct sent information to the deeper layers of awareness.
