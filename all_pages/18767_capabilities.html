<p>The user can create phenomena, typically defined as any observable event, allowing them to distort the laws of physics. For example, nightmares intruding into reality, an ignored person becoming invisible, ice forming from water by heat instead of cold, the reanimation of the dead, chemical transformations of the human body, the creation of robots and various extraordinary events. Basically this is the power to create home-works for Scientists.
