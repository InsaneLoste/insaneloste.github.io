<p>User can control <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memory" title="wikipedia:Memory">memories</a> of oneself and others, allowing them to modify, fabricate, suppress, influence, repair, restore, erase, detect, and view them. They can change memories to confuse, wipe away certain memories to cause amnesia, discern and provoke nostalgia, and enter the victim into a psychic vision, replaying their memory.
