<p>The user can utilize the Scientific Arts, a specialized system of techniques based around scientific power. Science involves the exploration and experimentation of various factors involving the universe. Various disciplines are involved in analyzing ordinary and/or extraordinary phenomena, ranging from the quantitative (mathematics) to the social (psychology). Normally, scientific study is geared toward acquisition of knowledge; however, this can be extended to gaining unique abilities and techniques through experiments and practice. Aside from augmenting physical power or combat skill, training in the sciences (especially the super sciences), being scientifically augmented/transformed or learning to wield science-based forces can lead to powers like altering the nature of matter and/or energy, creating godlike technology or even controlling existential laws.
