<p>User can physically experience the events from various points in time (past, future, alternate timelines etc.) as if they were actually happening to them at that moment but without actually going anywhere, allowing them to not only experience the event but also know what is going on then, including sights, smells, sounds, feelings, tastes, their emotional state at the time and even see and hear the people around them at that moment.
