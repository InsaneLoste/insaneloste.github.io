<p>Users with this trait can take on the abilities of a ro-langs or are one. A ro-langs is a type of zombie found in Tibetan folklore that can either be created by tantric rituals in order to serve a necromancer's will or be risen by a demonic entity that uses them to contaminate as many living beings as they can. The demonic variants are able to plague humans via touching their heads and, in some folk tales, would spread epidemic level plagues (the style of these zombies is strikingly similar to the modern idea of zombies in popular culture and may have helped shape this image to some extent.)
