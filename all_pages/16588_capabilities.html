<p><a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naraka_(Jainism)" title="wikipedia:Naraka (Jainism)">Naraka</a> is the hellish state of existence in the Jainism belief system. Beings that inhabit this sector of reality are subjected to elaborate torture and repeatedly murdered within an infinite variety of hells. They are doomed to reside within these hells for great periods of time (billions of years) but unlike Hell in other cosmologies, souls will eventually be set free from Naraka and return to the cycle of reincarnation.
