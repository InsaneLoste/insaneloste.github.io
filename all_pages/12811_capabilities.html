<p>The user can hear <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Infrasound" title="wikipedia:Infrasound">infra-sounds</a> which are below the normal hearing range, since infra-sounds are produced by several natural forces the user is able to sense natural disasters (earthquakes, volcanoes, etc.).
