<p>Users of this power are or can turn into bionic beings that holds unfathomable angelic power (androids or cyborgs) , allowing them to have abilities beyond that of mundane/ordinary machines. This could be due to the machine originating from angelic origins or a machine that is affected by a source of angelic power. This makes the machine a vastly powerful being, that allows them to level an entire area and overwhelm their foes, and even use their powers for good and creation.
