<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a <a class="external text" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nurarihyon" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">nurarihyon</a> (slippery gourd), originally unique yokai known as the "supreme commander of all monsters". They are the most powerful and elite of all yokai, and they are best known for their unique gourd-shape heads. One thing they are well known for is sneaking into peoples houses and using all the peoples belongings and generally acting like they not only live there but are actually the master of the house, and their power is so great that when the people finally notice his presence they actually believe the nurarihyon to be the rightful owner of the home while he is there.
