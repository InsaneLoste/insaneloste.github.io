<p>User with this ability either is or can transform into a mental entity, or an entity of pure mental energy. Users' transformed form is anatomically identical to their normal form, aside of being made of energy, in which case, it contains all to organs and is somewhat vulnerable to attacks. Alternately, the user can transform into homogeneous matter, without any part of their form being more important than the other.
