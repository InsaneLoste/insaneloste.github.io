<p>Users either are or can become a Frittening  (also known as a Boneless) or are a member of this species. The Frittening is described as a strange and malevolent entity resembling a putrid mass of stinking pale organic matter that continually shifted, with any who gazed upon it going insane, it would attack any it came across but also spread disease and misfortune wherever it went.
