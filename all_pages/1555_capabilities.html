<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antiparticle" title="wikipedia:Antiparticle">antiparticles</a>, particle components that possess the same mass as traditional particles but opposing charges and/or properties. Traditional particles are generally what are encountered in oneâ€™s specific environment, while antiparticles usually come about under certain conditions or even from different realms. When particles and antiparticles meet each other under the right conditions, they will cancel each other out and produce other forms of energy such as light.
