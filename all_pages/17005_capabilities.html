<p>The user can create a void outside the space-time continuum where nothing can be created nor destroyed because there is nothing to create or destroy. There is no personality or individuality because beings cannot survive there. Even the concepts of reason, emotions, philosophy, reality, time and space, morality and even matter itself cannot exist in this realm. For anything that is engulfed by this realm, everything that once was becomes no more, because it will be forever erased by the overwhelming power/energies.
