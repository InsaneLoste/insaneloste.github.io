<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate any sort of <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Armour" title="wikipedia:Armour">armor</a>, protective covering that is used to prevent damage from being inflicted to an object, individual, or vehicle by direct contact weapons or projectiles, usually during combat, or from damage caused by a potentially dangerous environment or action (e.g., cycling, construction sites, etc.). Personal armor is used to protect soldiers and war animals such as war horses (the application for the latter is called barding). Vehicle armor is used on warships and armored fighting vehicles.
