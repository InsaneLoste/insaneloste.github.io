<p>Users can regenerate from any damage done to their powers, whether they've been <a href="/wiki/Power_Dilution" title="Power Dilution">diluted</a>, <a href="/wiki/Superpower_Devolution" title="Superpower Devolution">devolved</a>, <a href="/wiki/Power_Reduction" title="Power Reduction">reduced</a>, <a href="/wiki/Power_Negation" title="Power Negation">negated</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Power_Erasure" title="Power Erasure">erased</a>, allowing them to use their powers at optimal condition over time. This also extends to recovering from power "burn-out" where the user has overused their ability.
