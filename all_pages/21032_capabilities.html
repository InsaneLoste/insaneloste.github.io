<p>User can hack reality as if they were hacking a game, which grants hacks used in games to win, including "Aimbot", "ESP", "Noclip", etc. Users can manipulate variables to customize their personal physical prowess. They may be able to create their own hacks, to further expand their arsenal. Users can also hack reality via techno eyesight which may turn their eyes black or another varying color. A dark red bar with black outline in the inside will appear that asks for a specific code to be entered (ex. "Enter Code"), prompting a dark green metaphysical keyboard to appear. All that would be needed is for the user to add this signÂ ! and type whatever words the user wants with the users words being dark gray in color (though the user will still be able to see the words clearly due to the users eyes and vision being augmented in the processed when accessing this power) to have as their code. Once done, all that's needed is to hit the 'enter button' and the code entered will become a part of reality. This is just one of the many ways that this power can be accessed and utilized.
