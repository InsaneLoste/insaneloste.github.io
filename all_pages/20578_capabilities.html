For example, they can alter the purpose of muscles to make them stronger and meant to lift heavy objects with little effort. They can also affect the purpose of a person's existence, and perhaps alter their destiny in a way. They can make any object be usable in ways they were not meant to. They can also alter a person or object's properties, such as shape, to make them be able to be used for the desired purpose.
