<p>The user with this ability either is or can transform into a daitya, a member of a group of divine giant ascetics and hermits, brāhmaṇas (priests) celestial beings and lunar asterisms. The Daityas represent the first state partaking of ‘Sattva.’ (or Truth/Goodness Seeking in Sanskrit), in Hindu/Buddhist mythology. These beings are related to the Asura and are also demons, but to a higher extent than the asuras.
