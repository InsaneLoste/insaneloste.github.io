<p>User canÂ duplicate the powers of those around them by channeling an emotion that are connected to the powers and reproduce them at will. (Ex, if the other subject is angry, a user can focus on the emotion in order to gain their ability, it's the same with fear etc). Either way, any emotion users' channel, can allow access to a person's power.
