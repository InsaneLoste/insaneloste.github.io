<p>The user's body parts can act independently from other body parts with causing them to interfere with the actions of the other body parts. This does mean the user can detach their body parts to make them independent, but they can perform acts such as shaking their hand with affecting the rest of the arm which remains still or making their forearm act faster or go in different directions than the upper arm, plus so much more with other body parts.
