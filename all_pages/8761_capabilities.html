<p>The user can restore other entities and beings who have been lost by various means, such as <a href="/wiki/Entity_Erasure" title="Entity Erasure">erasure</a>, <a href="/wiki/Entity_Absorption" title="Entity Absorption">absorption</a>, or <a href="/wiki/Entity_Destruction" title="Entity Destruction">destruction</a>. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Body_Creation" title="Body Creation">creation</a> and <a href="/wiki/Regrowth" title="Regrowth">regrowth</a>, the targets are not created from scratch or regrown, rather they are restored to the point as if they were never lost in the first place.
