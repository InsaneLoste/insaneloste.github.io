<ul><li>A person becomes a Fext through <a href="/wiki/Dark_Arts" title="Dark Arts">the intervention of malevolent entities</a> (whether practicing spells of a dark nature, or outright making a pact with a demon/devil).
<ul><li>Furthermore, if the magic is not performed correctly, or the demon/devil is tricky in how the pact is carried out, then the new Fext may gain <a class="mw-redirect" href="/wiki/Invulnerability" title="Invulnerability">Invulnerability</a>, but the body may still age--and perhaps decay-- similar to (though maybe slower than) a zombie, or even a regular corpse.</li></ul></li>
<li>Glass bullets or wooden stakes that are used to tie young trees may be used to permanently kill fext.</li></ul>
