<p>User can manipulate the abstracts (or concept) of water.Â This can have many feats, including water that can flow in any direction and against any force, not just in a downward gradient or manipulated by gravitational pull, water that can exist in specific matter states under ordinary pressure conditions despite temperature variations (such as water remaining liquid under normal pressure despite boiling or freezing temperatures) and even water capable of combining fluidly with substances that are normally unmixable like certain oils.
