<p>The user is able to generate/create <a class="external text" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Aurora" rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" target="_blank">aurora</a>, a natural light display in the sky particularly in the high latitude (Arctic and Antarctic) regions, caused by the collision of energetic charged particles with atoms in the high-altitude atmosphere (thermosphere). The charged particles originate in the magnetosphere and solar wind and, on Earth, are directed by the Earth's magnetic field into the atmosphere.
