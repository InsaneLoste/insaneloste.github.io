<p>User can manipulate their own vector fields. Anything of any matter and energy within them possesses a vector, allows them to perform various techniques. Users can accelerate momentum vectors to increase the strength of their actions, manipulate their gravitational vectors to achieve <a href="/wiki/Flight" title="Flight">weightlessness</a>, generate a powerful magnetic field that disrupts electronic devices, velocity vectors to gain speed and even control their personal vector field on a <a href="/wiki/Molecular_Manipulation" title="Molecular Manipulation">molecular level</a>.
