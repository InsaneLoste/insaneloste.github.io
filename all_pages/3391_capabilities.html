<p>User can create and/or manipulate a boundless reality/plane/world, one that is infinite/unlimited in scale and potential, allowing them to design a world with no boundaries or limitations on what can happen and where anything/everything is possible and anything can likely be found by traveling far enough. Boundless worlds may even expand in size and distance over time making them impossible to <a href="/wiki/Realm_Closure" title="Realm Closure">close</a> or <a href="/wiki/Sealing" title="Sealing">seal</a> off, also since the created world is borderless it may be impossible to leave without help. Some created worlds may likely even develop other worlds inside of themselves since they have no limitations on what happens to them.
