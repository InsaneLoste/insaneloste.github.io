<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Solar_phenomena" title="wikipedia:Solar phenomena">solar phenomena</a>, the various cosmological events and reactions stemming from activity within the sunâ€™s atmosphere. A solar environment generates exceptional amounts of energy, force and particles; while some of them can be contained to its vicinity, a great amount can be released into the surrounding space, causing different activity that can extend far beyond the star. Phenomena can include coronal mass ejections, sunspots and solar winds; these, in turn, can generate further events such as space weather, auroras and even climate alterations on distant worlds orbiting the sun.
