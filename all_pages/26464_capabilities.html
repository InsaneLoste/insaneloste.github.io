<p>Users can create/use defenses that cannot be perceived or understood by normal senses or in any other way at all, allowing them to block any attack or damage as their defenses are impossible to penetrate because they cannot be perceived. This includes defenses that move too fast to see, defenses that are so radically different that the mind doesn't know what its witnessing and thus can't see it, defenses that seem to be invisible for whatever reason, and much more.
