<ul><li>Changing form to and/or from tachyon particles may require large amounts of energy.</li>
<li>May not be in complete control of their equivalent tachyon particles.</li>
<li>Completely running out of energy achieves infinite speed, resulting in two oppositely charged tachyons with opposite momenta which annihilate each other, and the user would cease to exist.</li></ul>
