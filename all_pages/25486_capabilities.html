While such deities were ridiculed by outsiders they played vital roles in many cultures across history, due to the fact such places were often hazardous and places of disease - thus required special deities to watch over and protect the areas.
Toilet gods had dominion over fertility, health and well-being - while not often spoken of in mythologies there also exist a wide variety of toilet-demons, which toilet gods may also help keep at bay.
