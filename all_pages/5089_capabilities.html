<p>The user can cause damage that is precisely the shape of what they used to strike with when they caused the damage. No further damage is created. Just the exact shape of what hit it, whether a fist or a weapon, those things. This can also make it so that when moving (such as, but not limited to pulling) things out of a surface like the ground or a wall, they do minimal damage to what they are moving something out of.
