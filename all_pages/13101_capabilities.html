<p>The user possesses adaptively intelligent regeneration, meaning their healing factor does not multiply harmful cells such as tumors, instead, it repairs these sick cells to their original, optimal healthy forms. Also, it does not require a user to turn twisted/broken limbs/bones in the right orientation manually for their regeneration to occur. Even if something is jammed into the body, it does not prevent the user from regenerating as it can simply shift the obstacle to make the recovery complete. If a user gains this ability after birth, then the ability can also heal any and all birth defects such as heredity illnesses and unformed limbs.
