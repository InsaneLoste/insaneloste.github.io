<p>The user does not have any or all of the body parts that connect parts of the body. That means they have no hips, knees, ankles, shoulders, elbows and wrists. The other body parts, such as the upper leg, foreleg, upper arm and fore arm that are in between the connecting body parts are still there. They just float and stay near the body. Unlike <a href="/wiki/Jointlessness" title="Jointlessness">Jointlessness</a>, the user does not only have no joints of the connecting body parts, but they have no muscle, bone or anything that makes them up as well.
