<p>User can manipulate the abstracts (or concept) of darkness. This can have many feats, such as darkness that can prevent light from existing, darkness that makes things more visible rather then less, produce darkness/shadows that can exist without light, harm things that can <a href="/wiki/Shadow_Absorption" title="Shadow Absorption">absorb</a> or are <a href="/wiki/Umbrakinetic_Immunity" title="Umbrakinetic Immunity">immune</a> to darkness, produce shadows/darkness that can consume or negate other forms darkness/night/shadows, and much more.
