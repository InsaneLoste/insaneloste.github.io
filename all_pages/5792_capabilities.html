<p>The user can create, shape and manipulate <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_matter" title="wikipedia:Dark matter">Dark Matter</a>, a hypothetical type of matter distinct from <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Matter#Baryonic_matter" title="wikipedia:Matter">baryonic matter</a> (ordinary matter such as protons and neutrons), <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cosmic_neutrino_background" title="wikipedia:Cosmic neutrino background">neutrinos</a> and <a class="extiw" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_energy" title="wikipedia:Dark energy">dark energy</a>. The name refers to the fact that it does not emit or interact with electromagnetic radiation, such as light, and is thus invisible to the entire electromagnetic spectrum. Although dark matter has not been directly observed, its existence and properties are inferred from its gravitational effects, and it is estimated to make up 84% of the universe's mass and 23% of its mass-energy.
