<p>The user can merge probabilities and possibilities together. If the possibilities are different from each other, they can merge them to make them have an impact on one another, or otherwise make them have the same probability of happening. If the possibilities are similar, or are probabilities coming out of the same situation, their outcomes may be merged so that both or all outcomes happen in one unified probability.
